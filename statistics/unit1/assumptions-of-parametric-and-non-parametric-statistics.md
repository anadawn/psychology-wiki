# Assumptions of Parametric and Non-Parametric Statistics
## Assumptions of Parametric Statistics
Parametric tests like, `t` and `f` tests may be used for analysing the data which satisfy the following conditions:

- The population from which  the sample have been drawn should be normally distributed.

- Normal Distributions refer to  Frequency distribution following a normal curve, which is infinite at both the ends.

- The variables involved must have been measured interval or ratio scale.

- **Variable and its types:** characteristic that can have different values.

    #### Types of Variables

    - **Dependent Variable:** Variable considered to be an effect; usually a measured variable.
    - **Independent Variable:** Variable considered being a cause.

- The observation must be independent. The inclusion or exclusion of any case in the sample should not unduly affect the results of study.

- These populations must have the same variance or, in special cases, must have a known ratio of variance. This we call `homosedasticity`.

- The samples have equal or nearly equal variances. This condition is known as equality or homogeneity of variances and is particularly important
to determine when the samples are small.

- The observations are independent. The selection of one case in the sample is not dependent upon the selection of any other case.

## Assumptions of Non-parametric Statistics
We face many situations where we can not meet the assumptions and conditions and thus cannot use parametric statistical procedures. In such situation
we are bound to apply `non-parametric statistics`.

If our sample is in the  form of `nominal` or `ordinal` scale and the distribution of sample is not normally distributed, and also the sample size is
very small, it is always advisable to make use of the non-parametric tests for comparing samples and to make inferences or  test the significance
or trust worthiness of the computed statistics. In other words, **the use of non-parametric tests is recommended in the following situations:**

- `Where sample size is quite small`. If the size of the sample is as small as `N=5` or `N=6`, the only alternative is to make use of
non-parametric tests.

- When assumption like normality of the distribution of scores in the population are doubtful, we use non-parametric tests.

- When the measurement of  data is available either in the form of ordinal or nominal scales or when the data can be expressed in the form of
ranks or in the shape of `+` signs or `-` signs and classification like `good-bad`, etc, we use non-parametric statistics.

- The nature of the population from which samples are drawn is not known to be normal.

- The variables are expressed in nominal form.

- The data are measures which are ranked or expressed in numerical scores which have the strength of ranks.
