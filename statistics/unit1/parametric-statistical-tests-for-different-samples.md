# Parametric Statistical Tests for Different Samples
Suppose we wish to measure  teaching aptitude of  M.A. Psychology Students `(LARGE SAMPLE)`  by using a verbal aptitude teaching test.

- It is not possible and convenient to measure the teaching aptitude of all the enrolled M.A. Psychology Students trainees and **hence we must
usually be satisfied with a sample drawn from this population.**

- However, this sample should be as large and as randomly drawn as possible so as to represent adequately all the `M.A. Psychology Students` of
IGNOU.

- If we select a large number of random samples of `100 trainees` each from the population of all trainees, **the `mean values` of teaching
- aptitude scores for all samples would not be identical.**

- A few would be `relatively high`, a `few relatively low`, but most of them would tend to cluster around the `population mean`.

- The sample means due to `sampling error` will not vary from sample to sample but will also usually deviate from the population mean.
Each of these sample means can be treated as a single observation and these means can be put in a frequency distribution which is known as
`sampling distribution of the means`.

- An important principle, known as the `Central Limit Theorem`, describes the characteristics of sample means. **According to this theorem,
if a large number of `equal-sized samples`, greater than 30 in size, are selected at random from an infinite population:**
    - The means of the samples will be normally distributed.
    - The average value of the sample means will be the same as the mean of the population.
    - The distribution of sample means will have its own standard deviation.
    - This standard deviation is known as the `standard error of the mean` which is denoted as \\( \text{SE}_m \\) or \\( \text{贸}_m \\).
    - It gives us a clue as to how far such sample means may be expected to deviate from the population mean.
    - The standard error of a mean tells us how large the errors are in any particular sampling situation.
    - The formula for the standard error of the mean in a large sample is:
The standard error of the mean (SEM) is given by

       \\( \text{SE}_m \\) or \\( \text{贸}_m = \frac{\text{贸}}{N} \\).

        Where:
        - 贸 = **the standard deviation of the population**
        - N = **the size of the sample In case of small samples**

- In case of `small samples` the sampling distribution of means is not normal.

- **It was in about `1815` when `William Seely Gosset` developed the concept of small sample size.** He found that the distribution curves of
small sample means were some what different from the normal curve. This distribution was named as `t-distribution`. **When the size of the sample
is small, the t-distribution lies under the normal curve.**
