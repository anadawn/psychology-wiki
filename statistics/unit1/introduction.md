# Introduction
In this unit you will be able to know the various aspects of `parametric` and `non-parametric statistics`.

> *A parametric statistical test specifies certain conditions  such as the data should be normally distributed etc.*

> *The non-parametric statistics does not require the conditions of parametric stats.*

**In fact non-parametric tests are known as distribution free tests.** In this unit we will study the nature of quantitative data and various
descriptive statistical measures which are used in the analysis of such data. These include

- Measures of central tendency
- Variability
- Relative position
- Relationships of normal probability curve etc.

The computed values of various statistics are used to describe the properties of particular samples. In this unit we shall discuss `inferential` or
`sampling statistics`, which are useful to a researcher in making generalisations of inferences about the populations from the observations of the
characteristics of samples. For making inferences about various population values (parameters), we generally make use of `parametric` and
`non-parametric tests`.

The concept and assumptions of parametric tests will be explained to you in this section along with the inference regarding the means and
correlations of large and small samples, and significance of the difference between the means and correlations in large and small independent samples.

The assumptions and applications of analysis of variance and co-variance for testing the significance of the difference between the means of
three or more samples will also be discussed. In the use of parametric tests for making statistical inferences, we need to take into account
certain assumptions about the nature of the population distribution, and also the type of the measurement scale used to quantify the data.

In this unit you will learn about another category of tests which do not make stringent assumptions about the nature of the population distribution.
This category of test is called `distribution free` or `non-parametric tests`. The use and application of several non-parametric tests involving
unrelated and related samples will be explained in this unit.These would include

- Chi-square test
- Median test
- Man-Whitney U test
- Sign test
- Wilcoxon matched pairs signed-ranks test.
