# Advantages of Non-Parametric Statistics
- If the sample size is very small, there may be no alternative except to use a non- parametric statistical test.
- Non-parametric tests typically make fewer assumptions about the data and may be relevant to a particular situation.
- The hypothesis tested by the non-parametric test may be more appropriate for research investigation.
- Non-parametric statistical tests are available to analyse data which are inherently in ranks as well as data whose seemingly numerical scores
have the strength of ranks.

    > knowing at all exactly how much more anxious `A` is. Thus if the data are inherently in ranks, or even if they can be categorised only as `plus
    > or minus` (more or less, better or worse), they can be treated by non-parametric methods.*

- Non-parametric methods are available to treat data which are simply classificatory and categorical, i.e., are measured in nominal scale.
- Samples made up of observations from several different populations at times cannot be handled by  Parametric tests.
- Non-parametric statistical tests typically are much easier to learn and to apply than are parametric tests. In addition, their interpretation
often is more direct than the interpretation of parametric tests.
