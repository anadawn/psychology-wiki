# Disadvantages of Non-Parametric Statistical Tests
- If all the assumptions of a parametric statistical model are in fact met in the data and the research hypothesis could be tested with a
parametric test, then non-parametric statistical tests are wasteful.

> *The degree of wastefulness is expressed by the power-efficiency of the non-parametric test. It will be remembered that, if a non-parametric
> statistical test has power efficiency of say, `90 percent`, this means that when all conditions of parametric statistical test are satisfied the
> appropriate parametric test would be just as effective with a sample which is `10 percent` smaller than that used in non-parametric analysis.*

- Another objection to non-parametric statistical test has to do with convenience. Tables necessary to implement non-parametric tests are scattered
widely and appear in different formats `(The same is true of many parametric tests too)`.
