# Physical Development in Infancy

## Physical Growth
The first year of infant is characterised by `rapid physical growth`. **A normal baby doubles its birth weight in six months and triples it in a
year.** During that time,

> *There is `great expansion of the head and chest,` thus permitting `development of the brain`, `heart`, and `lungs`, the organs most vital to
> survival.*

> *The bones, which are relatively soft at birth, begin to harden, and the `fontanelles`, the soft parts of the newborn skull, begin to `calcify`,
> the small one at the back of the head at about `3 months`, the larger one in front at varying ages up to `18 months`.*

> *Brain weight also increases rapidly during infancy. By the end of the second year, the brain has already reached `75%` of its adult weight.*

> *Growth and size depend on environmental conditions as well as genetic endowment. For example:
> **severe nutritional deficiency during the mother’s pregnancy and in infancy are likely to result in an irreversible impairment of growth and
> intellectual development, while overfed, fat infants are predisposed to become obese later in life.***

> *Human milk provides the basic nutritional elements necessary for growth. However, in Western cultures supplemental foods are generally added to the
> diet during the first year.*

> *The newborn infant sleeps almost constantly, awakening only for feedings, but the number and length of waking periods
> gradually increases.*

> *By the age of `three months`, most infants have acquired a fairly regular schedule for sleeping, feeding, and bowel movements.
> By the end of the first year, sleeping and waking hours are divided about equally.*


## Maturation
`Maturation` refers to a **universal sequence of biological events in the central nervous system that permits a psychological function to appear,
assuming that the child is physically healthy and lives in an environment containing people and objects.** Maturation cannot cause a psychological
function to occur. It only sets the limits on the earliest time of its appearance.

`Biological events` in youth consider as maturation, when they grow between `12` to `15` years. It is an age of maturation and releases hormones
from the pituitary gland located at the brain. But environmental factors, such as the quality of nutrition during childhood, can accelerate the
emergence of puberty by several years.
