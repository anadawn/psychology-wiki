# Concept of Infancy Period
A child goes through the various stages in his full life such as `infancy`, `childhood`, `adolescence`, `adulthood` and lastly `old age`. This is the
beginning period for a child and fastest period. Infancy period is defined in many areas, **some by medical practitioners who define this period as of
the period of young child.** iThey do not specify any  age limits.  Some psychologists use the word `infant` in much the same way as members of the
medical profession do.

**Infant is minor and is struggling for reaching the age of legal maturity.** He is so helpless person and dependent on other persons. The first two
years of an individualâ€™s life are the time of his most rapid development. Although every child develops at its own rate, each grows up in an orderly
and predictable patterns.

**`Cephalocaudally` means the development takes place from head to tail  and proximodistally  means  from trunk to extremes.** The behaviour and
ability of 2 year old  children are different from that of older children. The two year old children can `eat`, `cry`, `move`, `babble`, `play`,
`kick`, and `smile`. Two year old  children has the absence of qualities such as the `ability to speak`, `to act with intention`, `to reason`,
`to be self-conscious`, and to `experience the emotion of guilty`, `empathy` and `pride`.

Psychologists like `Sigmund Freud`, `Erik Erikson` and `Jean Piaget` highlighted a different aspect of an infant because each was loyal to
assumptions that were part of the larger cultural context in which they lived.
