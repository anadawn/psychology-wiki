Proper language development is the main concern in the early childhood. **Language is the only powerful tool to enhance the ability of cognitive
development.** As we have already read that unclear communication may create the hazards for the development of a child.  **A good language always
allows the child to communicate or interact with others persons and solve their problems.**

- However, the `eight-year` old still reasons in concrete ways and has difficulty understanding abstract ideas.

- `Beginning the first three years of life`, children develop a spoken vocabulary of between `300` and `1,000` words, and they are able to use language
to learn about and describe the world around them.

- By `age five`, a childâ€™s vocabulary will grow to approximately `1,500` words. Five-year-olds are also able to produce `five` to `seven` word
sentences, `learn to use the past tense`, and `tell familiar stories using pictures as cues`.

story about a picture seeing the relationships therein.** Between objects and happenings At the age of seven years a child masters the
consonants s-z, r, voiceless th, ch, wh, and the soft g as in George .
