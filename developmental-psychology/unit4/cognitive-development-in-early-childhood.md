# Cognitive Development in Early Childhood
`Jean Piaget` described two processes of behaviour:

- Assimilation
- Accomodation.

- **Assimilation:**  is the process of using or transforming the environment so that it can be placed in preexisting cognitive structures.

    > *Let us take an example of an infant who  uses a sucking schema that was developed by sucking on a small bottle when attempting to suck on a
    > larger bottle*.

- **Accomodation:** is the process of changing cognitive structures in order to accept something from the environment.

    > An example of accomodation would be when the child needs to modify a sucking schema developed by sucking on a pacifier to one that would be
    > successful for sucking on a bottle.

As `schemas` become increasingly more complex `(i.e., responsible for more complex behaviours)` they are termed `structures`. As one’s structures
become more complex, they are organised in a hierarchical manner `(i.e., from general to specific)`.

## Stages of Cognitive Development
`Piaget` identified four stages of cognitive development

- Sensory motor stage `(birth- 2 years)`
- Preoperational stage `(2-7 years)`
- Concrete operational stage `(7-11 years)`
- Formal operational stage `(11-above)`.

**At the `pre-operational stage` (Play age and Early Childhood) intelligence is demonstrated through the use of `symbols`, `language use which
matures`, and `memory` and `imagination` are developed, but thinking is done in a `non logical`, non `reversible manner`.**

`Egocentric` thinking also predominates at this stage.  Children form stable concepts and mental reasoning begins to develop.

- From `2-4 years` children develop `symbolic reasoning` (the ability to picture an object that is not present.).
**Egocentrism starts out strong in early childhood, but weakens**. Magical beliefs are constructed.

- Between `4-7 years` of age the child develops intuitive thought (the use of primitive reasoning skills and wondering `why`). Starting school is
a major landmark for children at this age.

`Piaget` also noted that children feel great difficulty to accept the views of others and Piaget called this `egocentrism`. **Egocentrism is when
children experience difficulty in experiencing others person’s perspective**.

As we know that this is called  a play age and many schools are adopting the Piaget’s theory of cognitive development, which provides part of the
foundation for constructive learning. Discovery learning and supporting the developing interests of the child are two primary instructional
techniques. It is recommended that parents and teachers challenge the child’s abilities. It is also recommended that teachers use a wide variety
of concrete experiences to help the child learn (example, use of manipulatives, group work, field trips or work, etc.).
