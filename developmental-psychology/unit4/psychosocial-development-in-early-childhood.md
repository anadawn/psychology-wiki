# Psychosocial Development in Early Childhood
`Erik Erikson’s (1902-1994)` theory of psychosocial development describes the impact of social experience across the whole lifespan. The theory of
psychosocial development is one of the best-known theories of personality in developmental psychology.

> *The word `psychosocial` is Erikson’s term, effectively from the words `psychological` (mind)  and `social` (relatioships).*

He believed that his psychosocial principle is genetically inevitable in shaping human development, and it occurs in all people.  **In early childhood
years, children start to develop self-conscious emotions, instead of purely reacting to caregivers’ or other adults’.**

**For example:**

> *Younger children feel perfectly happy himself and will not  experience negative emotions until caregivers express their displeasure at the messy
> situation. Children may still enjoy playing with the play mates at early childhood stage and they may feel happy when they get praise or reward
> from the family members.*

> *According to Erickson’s developmental theory, children start to evaluate themselves at the early stage of development of `Autonomy versus Shame and
> Doubt.` At the end of this stage, young children’s self-evaluations are either autonomous and positive, or negative and ashamed. Young children who
> feel autonomous see themselves as good, valuable people who are able to do what is expected of them in a positive way. In contrast, young children
> who feel ashamed also feel worthless and incapable of doing what is expected of them.*

As children become increasingly self-aware, more effective at communicating, and better at understanding the thoughts and feelings of others,
their social skills increase.

Children in the early childhood stage become skilled at modifying and expressing their emotions to fit different social situations.

**For example:**

> *Billy may feel angry, but he knows that having a tantrum at school is inappropriate. Similarly, Sally learns that acting pleasant and happy even
> if she feels shy and scared is a better way to meet people at a birthday party when she doesn’t know many of the other children.*

Changing or controlling one’s emotions in social situations is an important skill that allows children to fit in with groups and start to create
interpersonal relationships. Children who successfully complete this stage feel secure and confident, while those who do not are left with a sense
of inadequacy and self-doubt.
