# Physical Development in Early Childhood
Early childhood period is more developing period in respect to the `cognitive`, `physical`, `social` and `language`.
`Erikson`, `Kohlberg`, `Piaget`, and `Bronfenbrenner`, explain the more subtle changes that occur inside the body. **Physical changes in early
childhood are accompanied by rapid changes in the child’s cognitive and language development**. From the moment they are born, children use all
their senses to attend to their environment, and they begin to develop a sense of cause and effect from their actions and the responses of caregivers.

- **Height:** Growth rate slows. The average child in this stage grows `21/2 inches in height` and `5-7 pounds` per year.

- **Weight:** `The average annual increase in weight is 3 to 5 pounds`. **At age 6, children should gain weight approximately six times as much as
they did at birth.** The average `girl` weighs `48.5 pounds`, and the average `boy` weighs `49 pounds`. Body fat declines during preschool years.

- **Body build:** Body differences are fairly seen during this period. Some children have an `endomorphic` of flabby, fat body, some have
`mesomorphic` sturdy look, muscular body build and some have an ectomorphic or thin body. `Boys have more muscle while girls have more fat.`
The boy’s muscles become larger, stronger, and heavier.

- **Motor skills:** `Gross` and `fine` motor skills progress rapidly.
  > *Gross motor skills include `running`, `skipping` and `jumping`.*

  > *Fine motor skills include `turning pages of a book` and `learning to write and draw`.*

- **Brain development:** The most important physical development during early childhood is the brain and nervous system growth.

- **Body proportion and shape:** `The average preschool child requires 1700 calories per day.` **Well balanced meals are important in this stage
because their diet affects skeletal growth, body shape and susceptibility to disease.**

- **Teeth:** During the first four to six months of this stage, the last four baby teeth-the back molars-erupt. During the last half year of early
childhood, the baby teeth begin to replaced by permanent teeth. When early childhood is over, the child generally has one or two permanent teeth in
front and some gaps where permanent teeth will eventually erupt.
