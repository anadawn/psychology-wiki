# Meaning of Early Chilhood
Many psychologists define early childhood term in many ways. In a simple term early childhood age often focuses on children learning through play.
It generally includes toddler hood and some time afterwards. Sometimes it is called a `play age`.

**It is also defined as the period from birth to 8 years of age. A time of remarkable brain development, these years lay the foundation for subsequent
learning `(UNESCO)`.** The terms preschool or kindergarten age emphasise education around the ages of `3â€“6 years`. The terms `early childhood
learning`, `early care`, and `early education` are comparable with early childhood education.

The terms day care and childcare do not embrace the educational aspects. Many childcare centers are now using more educational approaches.
They are creating curricula and incorporating it into their daily routines to foster greater educational learning.

Researchers in the field and early childhood educators both view the parents as an integral part of the early childhood education process.
Early childhood education takes many forms depending on the beliefs of the educator or parent.
