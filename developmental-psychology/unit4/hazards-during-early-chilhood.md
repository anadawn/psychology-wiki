# Hazards During Early Chilhood
There are some hazards during early childhood, which are divided into two categories:
- Physical hazards
- Psychological hazards.

## Physical hazards
Some of physical hazards that affect the children  during the early childhood.

- **Illness:** Illness is highly susceptible in early age. Children are more prone to respiratory illness and wide spread infectious diseases.
Today many viruses are spread in the air, if children are affected to this virus they will fall sick.  **Children who are sick for an extended time
fall behind in their learning of skills needed for play and other activities.**

- **Accidents:** The chances of deaths in early years are high because of accidents than at any other age.

   > *Some studies suggest that `boys` are having more accidents than the counterpart of `girls`.*

   Most young children face the problems of getting `knife and blade cuts`, `burns`, `infections` and `broken bones`, etc.  Some also get into
   physical accidents which may disable them  temporarily or permanently.

- **Obesity:** Obesity is always a hazard in early childhood years. **Children with `endomorphic body builds` tend, as a group, to have more problems
with obesity than do those who have `mesomorphic body build`.** Children who are very fond of food, and having a typical personality are more prone
to diabetics and heart attacks, as compared to normal children. This is also a health hazard in early period of development. Having  junk food
regularly make  children more obese.

## Psychological hazards
The common psychological hazards are discussed here:
- **Speech hazards:** Communication is an important tool for social belonging. They can communicate through their speech or language. Some time their
language is not understandable to others and their communication is not clear and this will lead to the feelings of inadequate and inferiority.
The quality of speech is  poor in young children.

- **Social hazards:**  There are number of social hazards in early childhood. **If a child has some communication problem he may be unpopular with the
peer group children.**
    > *Such children may feel not only the lonely but also feel deprived of opportunities to learn to behave in a peer approved manner*.

    Some times children develop unhealthy social attitudes. **Young children who have  experiences of discrimination and prejudice because of
    `religion`, `caste or sex`, they manifest biased behaviours**. As a result they minimize the contacts with the people at outside the home or
    inside the home.

- **Play hazards:** Children who feel isolated in the play ground and lack of playmates, either because of geographical isolation or because they
are not forced to engage in solitary forms of play, stand to be rejected by other children and do not develop the needed motor and other related
skills and thus may feel handicapped and inferior to other children.

- **Moral hazards:** Inconsistent discipline slows down the process of learning to conform to social expectations. Children are confused when they
find that different people have different views about the particular behaviour.
