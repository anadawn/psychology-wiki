# Environmental Influences
So far in today’s advanced technology, the fetus has been considered to be an active part of research  in its own development. Many scientists
believe that anything that affects the environment of the fetus can have an effect upon the development beginning at conception and not at birth.
Environment does indeed begin to influence the individual as soon as he or she is conceived.

**As the `zygote` undergoes `mitosis` (cell division), the new cells themselves become part of the mother’s environment, and through their particular
physical and chemical influence they guide and control the development of further new cells.**

> *Different genes are activated or suppressed in each cell, so that while one group of cells is developing into brain tissue, another is giving
> rise to the heart, another to the lungs, and another to the skeletal system. Meanwhile, the lump of cells is surrounded by the larger environment
> of the mother’s uterus, and this environment is surrounded by the mother and the world in which she lives.*

1. **Mother’s diseases:** Mother’s diseases is the main cause of fetal death and their possible effects. `German measles` or `rubella` and
`cytomegalovirus diseases` are among the most potentially dangerous of the infectious diseases in mothers. These diseases that affect  the mother
also affects the  child and thus affects adversely the development. **Studies have shown that there is a  high incidence of defective babies if
women  contracted `rubella` early in pregnancy.**

   > *In any case if the `rubella` virus crosses the `placenta` it can  result in `stillbirth`,
   > `deafness`, `pre maturity`, `miscarriage`, `defects in pancreas`, `heart and liver`.  It may also lead to `mental retardation`.*

   `Mumps`, `polio` and `influenza` are the other viruses which have `teratogenic effects`.
   > *Diabetic mother is as likely to give birth to infants with congenital malformations as non diabetic mother, and their infant often will
   > have respiratory difficulties soon after birth.*

   > *Women who are suffering from `blood poisoning` during pregnancy frequently give birth to premature babies or to babies smaller than average
   > babies. In case this blood poisoning is `incurable`, this may affect the mother and child both.*

1. **Drugs and Chemicals:** For a healthy delivery it is necessary to avoid any kind of drugs and chemicals  unless they are professionally
recommended by the doctors.

    > *`Alcohol`, `antihistamines`, `aspirin (excess doses)`, `barbiturates`, `heroin`, `lead`, `quinine`, `thalidomide`,
    > `insulin (large doses, used in shock therapy)` and `tobacco` are the drugs and chemicals which affect the possible prenatal period development.*

    In many cases, the drugs cause `stunting` or `complete absence of the arms, legs, and fingers`. Abnormalities of the internal organs may also
    occur.

    > *`Abel, (1980)` and `Stechler and Halton, (1982)` found in their research that **greater consumption of alcohol is known to harm the developing
    > embryo and fetus.** Having an occasional drink may not be harmful to the mother or fetus. During  pregnancy time **more than three times
    > consumption of drinks per day would lead to  children showing `permanent growth retardation`,  `brain cell abnormalities`, `eye, ear and
    > other facial disfigurations`,  `joint and limb abnormalities`, `heart defects`,  `mental retardation`,  and `attention deficits`.** Even smaller
    > daily consumption of alcohol by pregnant women may result in poor attention and reaction time in their children at preschool age.*

    It has been noted that **cigarette smoking had a high risk of delivering prematurely.** It is associated with `prematurity` and `low birth
    weight`. These children may suffer from later growth and cognitive deficiencies.  A pregnant woman should guard against exposure to all drugs
    and chemicals during pregnancy, but she must be particularly careful about taking drugs.

1. **Radiation:** Radiation is responsible for causing damage to the fetus. **Larger doses of therapeutic radiation may be injurious to the fetus
and sometimes cause spontaneous abortion.** There really seems to be no completely safe level of radiation.  Even the  various levels of natural
radiation found in different parts of the world can be correlated with  higher or lower chances of babies born in those parts of the world to have
congenital abnormalities.

1. **Abortion:** Termination of pregnancy could be due to natural causes or a pregnancy may be terminated medically due to certain  medical reasons.
Abortion procedure is generally  performed by a licensed physician in a hospital or clinic and  it is carried out before the pregnancy advances
beyond a specified number of weeks. With modern antiseptic and surgical techniques, abortion in the early months of pregnancy is safer than
childbirth. The opposition to abortion now is based on moral and religious, not medical, grounds.

1. **Age of the mother:** The maternal age have a higher risk for infant defect, prematurity and infant death `(Jensen, Benson, and Bobak,
1981; Vital and Health statistics, 1972)`.

    > *In older woman (woman over 35 years) the ova, which have been present in an immature state from birth,
    > may have been affected by aging or exposure to chemicals, drugs and other harmful agents.*

    > *In young women (women under 18 years) the reproductive system may not be fully developed. Pregnant teenagers may also have generally
    > poor prenatal care.

1. **Nutrition/ Diet  of the mother:** The mother is the only sole source of nutrition for the unborn child, a diet providing the proper balance
of `proteins`, `fats`, `carbohydrates`, `minerals`, and `vitamins` is vital. **Many correlational studies of humans indicate a relationship between
`maternal diet deficiencies` and `prematurity`, `low birth weight`, `stillbirth`, `growth retardation`, and `poor mental functioning` `(Knobloch and
Pasamanick, 1974)`.**
    > *Diet deficiencies during the first trimester of pregnancy are specially  harmful, but deficiencies during the last trimester may also be
    > important because of rapid brain growth during that time `(Laster, 1975)`.*

    Poor nutrition may simply not meet the diet needs of the fetus. It may also act indirectly by increasing the mother’s vulnerability to pregnancy
    complication and disease.

1. **Stress in the mother:** The effects of maternal stress are less important than the effects of maternal nutrition but some studies strongly
believe that **maternal stress may affect the fetus development `(Stechler and Halton, 1982)`**. It seems that maternal emotions could influence
the growing child.
    > *The emotions act through the autonomic nervous system that activates the `endorcrine glands`, which, in turn, regulate the secretion of
    > hormones such as `adrenalin`. Because hormones can pass through the placenta, they may affect the fetus.*

    **In a more recent study, motor depression in newborns was associated with anxiety rated in prospective mothers during the last month of
    pregnancy, but also with the use of medication during child birth `(Standley, ZSoule, and Copans, 1979)`.

1. **The Rh Incompatibility:** The `Rh factor`, is an inherited protein found in the blood of 85% of the population. **The problem arises when the
male carries the `Rh positive factor`, the female does not carry the `Rh negative factors` and the child develops as `Rh positive`.**

    > *If the sibling blood comes into contact with the mother’s, the mother system may manufacture antibodies to ward off the foreign Rh protein.
    > The antibodies destroy the child’s oxygen- carrying red blood cells, a condition known as erythroblastosis and death or mental retardation
    > can occur.*
