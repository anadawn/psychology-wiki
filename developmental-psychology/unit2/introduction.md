# Introduction
**Prenatal development is the process in which an embryo or fetus, gestates during preganancy, from fertilisation until birth.** Often, the terms
`fetal development`, `foetal development` are used in a similar sense.Most physiologists and members of the medical profession believed that **most
development takes place before birth**. Development before birth takes place in three stages or period’s:

- Ovum
- Embryo
- Fetus.

Many factors are considered to understand the behaviour of a developing child. Mainly five factors are considered:

- Genetically determined biological variables
- Nongenetically determined  biological variables `(i.e., lack of oxygen during the birth process and malnutrition)`
- The child’s  past learning
- The immediate socio psychological environment `(parents, siblings, peers and teachers)`
- The social and cultural milieu in which the child develops.

We always considered biological and environment separately for ease of exposition but they always act in unison. This is as true of the individual
cell as it is of the whole person. The science of genetics and embryology has shown dramatic progress during the last 25 years.
