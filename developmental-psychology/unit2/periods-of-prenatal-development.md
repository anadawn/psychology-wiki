# Periods of Prenatal Development
**The prenatal period is `ten lunar months` of `twenty-eight days` each in length or `nine calendar months`.** However, the period can and does
vary greatly in length, ranging from `180-334` days. **There are approximately three times as many babies born prematurely as post maturely.**
`Meredith` has reported that the **average length of the prenatal period is 38 weeks or 266 days.** However, `70%` of babies vary from `36 to 40
weeks` or `266` days and `98%` range from `34 to 42 weeks` (238-294 days). The prenatal period is divided into three stages. These are:

- Period of the zygot
- Period of the embryo and
- Period of the fetus.

## Period of Zygote (fertilisation to end of second week)
Half of a person’s genetic material comes from his father and half comes from the mother. These two halves come together to form a unique combination
of genetic potentialities when the sperm fertilises the egg. **In the nucleus of the fertilised egg, or `zygote`, are the materials that bear the
pattern for a new person, one who is different from his parents and yet like them**. `This first cell in which the male genes are joined with the
female is called the Zygote`. The zygote looks like an unfertilised egg. The egg is so much larger than the sperm that it can absorb the sperm
without showing it. However, the unfertilised egg has only `twenty-three chromosomes`, whereas the `zygote` has `forty six`. The twenty three that
were in the egg originally and the additional twenty three contributed by the male.

> *Less than two days after the sperm unites with the egg, the zygote divides into two cells. Then these two cells each divide again, and the
> process of division goes on, forming in nine months a new human being.*

## Period of Embryo (end of the second week to end of the second lunar month)
**The embryo develops into a miniature human being.** This stage begins on the `15th day after conception` and continues until about the `8th week`,
or until the embryo is `1.2 inches in length`. During this period the cells of the embryo are not only multiplying, but they are taking on specific
functions. This process is called `tissue differentiation`. It is during this critical period of differentiation (most of the first trimester or
three month period) that the growing fetus is most susceptible to damage from external sources `(teratogens)` including viral infections such as
`rubella`, `x-rays` and other `radiation`, and `poor nutrition`.

A child who has one developmental problem may have other problems that arose at the same time.

> *`Kidney problems` and `hearing problems`, for example, are often found together because both kidneys and the inner ears develop at the same time.*

- **Formation of the heart begins in 3 weeks, the beginning development of the brain and spinal cord, and the beginning of the gastrointestinal tract.**
- `Teratogens` introduced during this period may cause severe problems such as the absence of one or more limbs or a heart that is outside of the chest
cavity at birth.

- Beginnings of the `vertebra`, the `lower jaw`, the `larynx (voice box)`, and the `rudiments of the ear` and `eye` develop at weeks `4 and 5
(1/4 inch long)`.

- The heart, which is still outside the body, now beats at a regular rhythm.

- Although arm and leg `buds` are visible with hand and foot `pads`,  the embryo still has a tail and cannot be distinguished from `pig`, `rabbit`,
`elephant`, or `chick` embryo by an untrained eye.

- `Teratogens` may cause very serious problems involving the `esophagus`, `vertebrae`, and `eyes`.  The baby could be born with severe facial clefts
or missing hands or feet.

- At week 6 `(1/2 inch, 1/1000 of an ounce)`, formation of the `nose`, `jaw`, `palate`, `lung buds` takes place.

- The fingers and toes form, but may still be webbed.  The tail is receding, and the heart is almost fully developed.

- Teratogens at this point may leave the baby with profound heart problems or a cleft lip.

- In the 7th week `(7/8 inch, 1/30 ounce)` eyes move forward on the face, and the eyelids and tongue begin to form.  All essential organs have begun
to form.

- `Teratogens` may cause heart and lung problems, a `cleft palate`, and `ambiguous genitalia (not quite male or female)`.

- At the 8th week `(1 inch, 1/15 ounce)` embryo now resembles a human being. The facial features continue to develop and the external ear appears.
Also, we see the beginnings of external genitalia. By now, the circulation through the umbilical cord is well developed. The long bones begin to form
and the muscles are able to contract. `Teratogens` may still cause heart problems and stunting of the fingers and toes.

## Period of Fetus (end of the second lunar month to birth)
At this point the embryo is developed enough to call a fetus.
- All organs and structures found in a full-term newborn are present.
- The head comprises nearly half of the fetus’ size and the face is well formed at weeks `9 to 12 (3 inches, 1 ounce)`.
- The eyelids close now and will not reopen until about the `28th week`.
- The tooth buds for the baby teeth appear.
- The genitalia are now clearly male or female.

Weeks `13 to 16 (6 inches)` mark the beginning of the second trimester.
- Although the skin of the fetus is almost transparent, fine hair develops on the head called `lanugo`.
- The fetus makes active movements, including `sucking`, which leads to some swallowing of the `amniotic fluid`.
- A thin dark substance called `meconium` is made in the `intestinal tract`.
- The heart beats `120-150 beats per minute` and brain waves are detectable.
- Eyebrows and lashes appear and nails appear on fingers and toes at week `17 to 20 (8 inches)`.
This is an exciting time for the parents:
- The mother can feel the fetus moving (quickening) and also hear the heartbeat with the help of `stethoscope`.
- All the eye components are developed, footprints and fingerprints are formed at week `21 to 24 (11.2 inches, 1 lb. 10 oz)` and the entire body is
covered in `cream cheese like vernix caseosa.`
- The fetus now has startle reflex action. Many reflexes, which are `automatic` and unlearned responses to specific `stimuli` appear:
  - Swallowing
  - Coughing
  - Sucking.
- During `25 to 28 weeks (15 inches, 2 lbs. 11 oz)` we can observe the rapid brain development of the fetus.
- The nervous system is developed enough to control some body functions, and the eyelids open and close.
>  *A baby born at this time may survive, but the chances of complications and death are high at this period.*
- The `29 to 32 weeks (15 to 17 inches, 4 lbs. 6 oz)` development occurs towards independent life. For example:

  > - *Respiration movements are predicted even though oxygen is being provided through the placenta.*
  > - *There is a rapid increase in the amount of body fat and the fetus begins storing its own iron, calcium, and phosphorus.*
  > - *The bones are fully developed, but still soft and pliable.*
  > - *There are rhythmic breathing movements present, the fetal body temperature is partially self-controlled, and there is increased central nervous
  >  system control over body functions.*

- The body hair begins to disappear at the week of `33 to 36 (16 to 19 inches, 5 lbs. 12 oz. to 6 lbs. 12 oz.)`.
>  *A baby born at `36 weeks` has a high chance of survival.*
- At `38 weeks (19 to 21 inches 7 or 8 pounds)` the fetus is considered full term. It fills the entire uterus, and its head is the same size
around as its shoulders.  The mother supplies the fetus with the antibodies it needs to protect it against disease.
