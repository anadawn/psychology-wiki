# Growth and Development
Growth refers to the development of children from birth to adolescence. From newborns to teenagers, parents often have questions if their children
are developing normally. WHO is also coordinating an international effort to develop child growth standards for infants and young children
(age 0-5 years). There is a process of  child development, which makes a growth curve. **Growth curve is defined as a statistical curve derived
from plotting weight and height against chronological age for comparing an individual child’s growth pattern with the average age of growth.**

**In short we can say that personality is influenced by  many factors and these factors are involved in the development of the  personality of
a child**.

> *The strongest factor in the process of  development of personality is `society` and the `child’s experiences in the society` and in
> the environment. Most of the children’s learning comes from the society, their surroundings and their experiences. Although these experiences are
> supervised by the parents and teachers, more often they occur in spontaneous family or neighborhood settings.  As such one finds that every child
> is different from the other.*

> *Another factor that influences personality is the `cultural factors`. Through everything from music, television, and incidental remarks overheard
> but hardly understood by the child to deliberate modeling and training, the child is encouraged to embody the typical or ideal personality of her
> culture.*

> *`Place` is the third factor which is  involved in the development of a child, in addition to the `biological factor`.*

As children  grow up from one stage to another, they  learn to make use of their  body parts,  learn how to express themselves and communicate
with others. They also learn to form relationship with others, how to care for others, how to love and how to work. Over the years, people who
study children have created theories to explain how children develop.

While these theorists realise that every child is special and grow in his or her unique way, they also have recognised that there are general
patterns that children tend to follow as they grow up, and these patterns have been documented by the theorists.

Also there are four areas in which children’s  growth and development take place and these are discussed below.

- **Physical:** *Physical growth is perhaps the most obvious. Children grow in height and weight over the years and their appearance changes to a great
extent during puberty. Children also develop certain physical abilities during their progression towards adulthood, including crawling, walking,
running and (possibly) writing. Their motor coordination becomes well refined  and they can shoot across a target relatively more accurately.*

- **Psychological and cognitive:** *Children also develop psychologically and cognitively as their brains absorb more information and they learn how
to use that information. Literally, children have to learn how to think on purpose and to process or organise all the information that comes to them
from the environment. They must learn how to solve problems, to talk, and to complete mental tasks such as remembering telephone numbers or using
computers.*

- **Social and emotional:** *Children grow socially and emotionally. They learn how to interact, play, work, and live with other people such as
family, friends, teachers, and employers. They learn how to understand both their own feelings and that of others’ emotions. They also learn ways
of dealing with strong emotions. **In order to function well as independent adults, children must develop a sense of self-esteem as they go through
the long process of figuring out what shape their identity will take**. They develop a sense of morality as they learn the difference between right
and wrong.*

- **Sexuality and gender identity:** *Children also develop sexually and form a gender identity. This development is unique because it spans
developments across the other physical, psychological, and social channels. Early on, children learn how their bodies work and look and what it
means to be a boy or a girl, they learn how boys and girls are different. As they grow older and enter adolescence and puberty, they continue to
learn how their bodies work sexually and how to responsibly handle their sexuality so as to balance their sexual desires and appropriate behaviour.
They continue to decide for themselves what it means to be masculine or feminine throughout their lifespan. Different theorists have come to different
conclusions concerning how exactly children develop across the various developmental channels. **Some theorists believe that children develop smoothly
and continuously, but other theorists believe that children develop more discretely in a series of stages, each of which is fairly stable.***


## Critical Periods During Development
There are certain periods of development known as difficult periods or critical periods. **It is said that children who do not get special stimulation
during their time of receptivity may get stuck at this period.**

> *For instance children learn to trust the parents if parents are consistently loving, affectionate and give the child care and love unconditionally.
> In such cases the child learns to trust its parent and from then onwards other adults in the environment.  However if the child is neglected and
> abused , not given the care, affection and love, he or she  may develop distrust of parents and this distrust will be transferred to other adults
> in the environment.*

**It must be remembered that even though the child’s development may have been adversely affected, if he or she is given an opportunity to be with
foster parents who care and love the child, the latter develops the capacity to trust other adults too in course of time.**
