# Facts of Development
We all know that development is the critical period for child development. Some significant facts must be taken into consideration to understand the
pattern of development. Each of these has important implications and is explained as follows:

1. **Early foundations are critical:**  Early foundations are critical because attitudes, habits and pattern of behaviour established during early
years determine to a large extent how successfully individuals will adjust in their later life.

1. **Role of maturation and learning in development:**  `Maturation and learning play a significant role in the development.` Maturation is unfolding
individual’s inherent traits. Learning is development that occurs from experience and efforts on the individual’s part. Maturation provides the
raw material for learning. Generally development is influenced by the interaction of both.

1. **Development follows a definite and predictable pattern:**  It follows a definite and predictable pattern. There are orderly patterns of
`physical`, `motor`, `intellectual` and `speech` development. Development is governed by certain laws:

   -  **Cephalocaudal Law** – It means that development spreads over the body from head to foot.
   -  **Proximodistal Law** – It means that development spreads outward from the central axis of the body to extremities.

1. **All individuals are different:**  `No two people react in the same way to the same environmental stimuli and, one can never predict with
accuracy how people will react to a situation.` These individual differences are significant because they are responsible for individuality in
personality make up.

1. **Each Phase of development has characteristic behaviour:**  Each Phase has certain characteristic behaviours. `The patterns are marked by
periods of equilibrium`, when individuals adapt easily to environmental demands and as a result make good personal and social adjustment and
by periods of disequilibrium, when they experience difficulty in adaptation, make poor personal and social adjustment.

1. **Hazards in each phase:**  `Each stage is related to certain hazards such as physical, psychological and environment.` These hazards inevitably
involve adjustment problems. We should be aware of these hazards because awareness of these makes it possible to prevent or to at least alleviate
these.

1. **Development is aided by stimulation:**  While most development occurs as a result of maturation and environmental experiences, much can be done
to aid development so that it will reach its full potential. `Stimulation is especially effective at the time when ability is normally developing`,
though it is important at all times.

1. **Cultural changes affect the development:**  `An individual’s development is molded to confirm to cultural standards and norms`, while changes in these standards affect the developmental pattern.

1. **Every stage has social expectation:**  `Every stage has certain societal expectation.` The individual will be successful in fulfilling those
expectations only if s/he is adhering to the rules and regulations of the family and society.

1. **Traditional beliefs:**  Traditional beliefs about physical and psychological characteristics affect the judgments of others as well as their
self evaluation. `So long as these beliefs persist, they have a profound influence on the development pattern`.
