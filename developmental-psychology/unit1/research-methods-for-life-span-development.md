# Research Methods for Life Span Development
As you know **development is a continuous process in a development of a child**. It occurs over a life time period, thus we need to special
techniques are employed to study the life span development. These techniques are discussed here:

1. **Longitudinal method:** `For the study of developmental changes in the same group or individual, over a period of time`, this method is useful.
The same individual is tested at different age group.
**Example:**

   >  *Case study of children behaviour in classroom.*

1. **Cross-section method:** `This method studies the development changes by testing individuals of different ages at the same time only once`.
This method helps to get the norms or standards of typical pattern of development for different age. `This is faster and cheaper method than
longitudinal method`. It does not loose subjects who dropout of the study since the subjects are tested only once. **Example:**

   > *Eating behaviour of 5 years old.*

1. **Sequential method:** To overcome the drawback of longitudinal and cross sectional method this method was used. `This is best method which
combines the longitudinal and cross-sectional method`. People in a cross-sectional sample are tested more than once and the results are analysed
to determined the differences that show up overtime for the different groups of subjects. This method gives a more realistic assessment.

1. **Time lag method:** `This method is studying the development of different age groups in different years to determine the effect of historical
events on behaviour.` This method is rarely used in developmental psychology, because it takes a long time and large numbers of subjects are required
and have to be the same age at the time of testing.
