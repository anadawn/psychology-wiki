# Obstacles in Stuyding Lifespan Development
There are some obstacles in the study of life span development. The five major obstacles are discussed in the following section:

1. **Representative Sample:** `The representative sample of a subject is the first obstacle for studying the developmental period.` The different age
level of the subject is the main concern for the researcher. The data collection from the school children is easy for the researcher but in the
case of new born or infant, it is not that much easy. They often face strong parental objection and their mood. Getting older adolescents and young
adults who are not attending school to volunteer a subject is also difficult because they may not be available for study at any one particular place.
`The difficulty arises with the young adult, middle aged adults, or old age person, when many persons shy away from the testing situation`.
They don’t want to disclose their person detail to the researcher, even they are paid off.

1. **Establishing rapport with the subject:** The establishing personal rapport to the subject is the second difficult task for the researcher.
`It is rather  difficult to get full personal detail about the subject.` They will never share their personal detail.  It  is also being noted that
`personal rapports vary from one stage to another stage`. Even school children and college students, who often fill tests as a part of their class
work, mostly they fill false information. There is no guarantee to the information being accurate. As, a result, `it is questionable whether data
obtained from the subject is the true picture of subject’s attitude, feelings, and values.` This obstacle may be reduce only by the personal rapport
with the subject.

1. **Appropriate Methodology:** Adaptation of an appropriate methodology is the main concern of a researcher. We take different age group subjects
in a study, some time our target group may be  one child, some time the subject may be an adult or some time he may be old person. `Because of the
wide age range of subject and the variety of different areas of development that must be studied to give a composite picture, assorted methods have
to be used.` Cross-sectional is the problem for researcher. **Cultural changes always play a role in the patterns of physical and mental
development of a child. These changes affect values of the subject.**

1. **Accuracy of data:** Accuracy of data is the fourth obstacle in studying the life span development. The data obtained from the studies will be
 accurate. `Inaccuracy of the data may show the picture of false information of normal development at a particular age given by the subject.`
 The data may vary in many cases such as in regard to intelligence being studied by different methods, or using  observational method for studying
 the behaviour, well-being, life satisfaction or happiness.  `The data vary for different age levels.` The accuracy of such measures is questionable.
 Even through the `longitudinal approach` has a methodology advantage over the `cross-sectional approach`, the problem of accuracy is still ever
 present.

1. **Ethical aspects:** The ethical aspect is a difficult task for the study of life-span development, as the rights of subject is to be considered
by the researcher, even if the subject is being paid by the researcher for the study. Consent of the subject if adult and consent of
parents/guardians if child  is an important and necessary step before  data collection. These considerations also apply to younger or older subjects.
