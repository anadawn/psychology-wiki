# Summary
In this unit we have studied about the `concept of development`, `growth and development`, `meaning of life span development` and `methods of studying
development`. The key points of our discussion in this unit are:


>  ***Development refers to the biological and psychological changes that occur in human beings between birth and the end of adoloscent period as the
> individual progresses from dependency to increasing autonomy.** Because these developmental changes may be strongly influenced by the genetic and
> enviornmental factors during prenatal life,  these  are the part of the study of child development*

>*`Growth` refers to the development of children from birth to adolescence.*

> *There are `four` areas, in which children grow, i.e.*
> - *Physical*
> - *Psychological and cognitive*
> - *Social and emotional*
> - *Sexuality and gender identity.*

> *According to `Educational Foundation (2001)` **lifespan development is a process beginning at conception that continues until death**.
> The progression initiates with the emergence of a fetus from a one celled organism. As the unborn child enters the world, the environment in which
> the child exists begins to influence the childâ€™s development.*

> *There are `four` interactive forces that combine to shape human development and these are*
> - *Biological forces*
> - *Psychological forces*
> - *Socio-cultural forces*
> - *Life cycle forces*

> *Characteristics of `life span development` included many development  as being  lifelong  and following a predictable pattern etc.
> To understand the pattern of development, certain fundamental facts must be taken into consideration. Each of these has important implications.*

> *To know the `developmental techniques` we need to use some `research methods`, such as*
> - *Longitudinal method*
> - *Cross-sectional method*
> - *Sequential*
> - *Time lag method*

> *There are some obstacles to apply the research methods  as sample not being representative.*

> *In some cases there is difficulty in establishing rapport with the subject and yet in certain other cases, the methodology used is not appropriate
> and thus the accuracy of data  becomes questionable.*

> *In some cases the  ethical aspects of research create difficulty in getting the subject to cooperate and the researcher to collect the data.*
