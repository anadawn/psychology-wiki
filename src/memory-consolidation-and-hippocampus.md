# Memory Consolidation and Hippocampus
**Memories are solidified in long-term stores over days, weeks, months, and years**. This process is referred to as `consolidation`,
an old concept that refers to how long term memory develops over time after initial acquisition. From a cognitive neuroscience perspective,
**consolidation is conceived of as biological changes that underlie the long-term retention of learned information, and we can ask what brain
structures and systems support this process**.

Because damage to the medial temporal lobe does not wipe out most of the declarative memories formed over a lifetime, we know that the **hippocampus
is not the repository of stored knowledge**. Rather, the medial temporal lobe appears to support the process of forming new memories, that is,
**the hippocampal region is critical for the consolidation of information in long term memory**.

> *The strongest evidence that the hippocampus is involved in consolidation comes from the fact that amnesics have retrograde amnesia for memories
> from one to a few years prior to the damage to the medial temporal lobe or diencephalon, a pattern that does not support a storage role but rather
> a role in consolidation*.

What might consolidation entail at the neural level? One idea is that consolidation strengthens the associations between multiple stimulus
inputs and activations of previously stored information. The hippocampus is hypothesised to coordinate this strengthening, but the effects
are believed to take place in the `neocortex`. **The idea is that once consolidation is complete, the hippocampus is no longer required for
storage or retrieval**.

Nonetheless, keep in mind that although the memories are stored in the neocortex, the hippocampus is crucial for consolidation.

## Alcoholic Korsakoff’s Syndrome and Diencephalic Amnesia
The medial temporal lobe is not the only area of interest in human memory. Amnesia emerges from brain damage in other regions too.

For example

> *damage to midline structures of the diencephalon of the brain causes amnesia. The prime structures are the dorsomedial nucleus of the thalamus
> and the mammillary bodies `(Figure 1.3.2)`. Damage to these midline subcortical regions can be caused by `stroke`, `tumors`, and `metabolic
> problems` like those brought on by chronic alcoholism as well as by trauma*.

In the last half of the nineteenth century, the Russian psychiatrist `Sergei Korsakoff` reported an anterograde and retrograde amnesia associated
with `alcoholism`. **Long term alcohol abuse can lead to vitamin deficiencies that cause brain damage**.

> *Patients suffering from alcoholic Korsakoff’s syndrome have degeneration in the `diencephalon`, especially the `dorsomedial nucleus` of the
> `thalamus` and the `mammillary bodies`.

It remains unclear whether the dorsomedial thalamic nucleus, the mammillary bodies, or both are necessary for the patients’ amnesia.
Nonetheless, **damage to the diencephalon can produce amnesia**.
