# Summary

> *The ability to acquire new information and retain it over time defines learning and memory.*

> *Cognitive theory and neuroscientific evidence argue that memory is supported by multiple cognitive and neural systems. These systems support
> different aspects of memory, and their distinctions in quality can be readily identified.*

> *`Sensory registration`, `perceptual representation`, `working memory`, `procedural memory`, `semantic memory`, and `episodic memory` all
> represent systems or subsystems for learning and memory.*

> *The brain structures that support various memory processes differ, depending on the type of information to be retained and how it is
> encoded and retrieved.*

> *Despite the intriguing results from neuropsychological studies, we are far from having a complete picture of how the brain instantiates all,
> or even many, memory phenomenon.*

> *It is not clear which aspects of memory are localised in one place in the brain and which are distributed across different cortical regions.*

> *`Tulving` pointed that neuroscientists today reject the idea of studying memory as though it were a single process. Instead, they are likely
> to look for neurological underpinnings at a more precise level at such processes as encoding or retrieval.*

> *The latest neuroimaging techniques clearly will continue to provide invaluable information about human memory and its neural substrates in
> the healthy human in the years to come.*
