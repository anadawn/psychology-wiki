# Theories of Information Processing
There are important theories which explain information processing.  Some of the major theories are presented in the following section.

## Designing Instruction that Incorporates Best Practices for Information Processing
The understanding of how the mind processes and stores information is invaluable to educators as they plan for instruction.
If there is little to no understanding of the information processing skills of the students with whom one is working, it would be
almost impossible to design instruction that contributes to high levels of learning and achievement. However, **attempting to understand
the myriad theories of information processing and cognitive development can be overwhelming and contradictory.**

There are means of structuring instruction, though that can incorporate the best of all of these ideas, and **in order to help students
reach higher-level thinking and learning skills, educators must draw from all of these theories**.

> If learning is to occur, educators must ensure that new information is processed in such a way that it can be retained in long-term memory.

In order to achieve this, **elaboration and connection must occur between previously learned memory and new information**.

> It has been established that the more deeply information is processed and the more connections that can be made between new information
> and existing memory structures, the more information will be retained in long term memory.

Therefore, **in order to make new material meaningful, instruction must be presented in such a way that students can easily access and
connect previous learning and experiences with the new material**.

> One of the most often cited references to levels of elaboration for instructional purposes is the `Taxonomy of the Cognitive Domain
> developed by Bloom and his colleagues (Bloom, Englehart, Furst, Hill, & Krathwohl, 1956)` and recently revised by `Anderson and Krathwohl (2000)`.

## Bloom’s Taxonomy of Cognitive Domain
`Bloom et al. (1965)` proposed that information processing can be classified in six levels, each more complex than the previous.
- The first level is labeled `knowing` and simply **requires a learner to repeat back what was heard or seen**. This involves very little
elaboration.
- The second level is labeled `comprehension` and **requires some rudimentary levels of understanding that might involve having the
student summarize or paraphrase some information. Again, this requires only modest levels of elaboration.
- The next two levels, `application` and `analysis`, **involve more elaboration and show a significant impact on long-term learning when
they are used during the learning process**.

> `Application` involves using the concepts or principles to solve a problem, while `analysis` involves understanding the relationship among
> the parts and how they are organised into a whole.

- The last two levels, `synthesis` and `evaluation`, **are the most complex and require the highest levels of elaboration**.

> `Synthesis` involves putting the parts or components together in an original manner, while `evaluation` is the process of making judgments
> based on comparison to a standard.

**Research has confirmed that the first four levels are indeed a hierarchy, while there seems to be a problem with the ordering of the two
highest levels `(Hummel & Huitt, 1994)`**.

> `Anderson and Krathwohl (2000)` propose that the ordering is reversed, with evaluation being less difficult than synthesis,
> while `Huitt (2000)` proposes that they are both at the same level of difficulty though they incorporate different types of processing.

There seems to be consensus that both synthesis and evaluation are based on analysis or the ability to compare and contrast parts of a whole
and understand the relationship among parts.

## Sternberg’s Information Processing Approach
Another theorist firmly grounded in the information processing approach is `Sternberg (1988)`. Sternberg’s theory suggests that **development is
skills-based and continuous rather than staged and discontinuous as stage theorists believe, and his focus is on intelligence**.
> This focus on intelligence separates his ideas from stage theorists because it rejects the idea of incremental stages, but rather suggests
> that **development occurs in the same way throughout life differentiated only by the expertise of the learner to process new information**.

First, and very importantly, Sternberg’s model does not differentiate between child and adult learning. Also, he deals solely with information
processing aspects of development and does not incorporate any facets of biological development into his theory.

Cognitive development is viewed as a novice to expert progression, as one becomes better at interaction and learning, one is able to learn more
and at higher levels. Development changes as a result of `feedback`, `self-monitoring`, and `automatisation`. In this theory, intelligence is
comprised of three kinds of information processing components:
- Metacomponents
- Performance components
- Knowledge-acquisition components.

In `Sternberg’s (1988)` model, each of these three components works together to facilitate learning and cognitive development.

- `Metacomponents` are executive in nature. They guide the planning and decision making in reference to problem solving situations, they serve
to identify the problem and connect it with experiences from the past. There is, however, no action directly related to metacomponents,
they simply direct what actions will follow.

- `Performance components` are the actions taken in the completion of a problem-solving task. Performance components go beyond metacomponents
in that they perform the function also of weighing the merit and or consequences of actions in comparison to other options rather than simply
identifying options.

- `Knowledge-acquisition component` is characterised by the ability to learn new information in order to solve a potential problem. This type is
much more abstract and may or may not be directly related to a current problem-solving task `(Driscoll, 2001)`.

> This three-leveled view of intelligence comprises the componential aspect of Sternberg’s theory, but this is only one of three parts to his
> larger `triarchic theory of intelligence (Kearsley, 2001)`.

`Sternberg’s (1988)` theory adds the components of feedback to theories of cognitive development this suggests that an **individual’s social
interaction has some impact on cognitive development**. In fact, one of the three parts of his theory is based on the context in which learning
takes place, this subpart of the theory **specifies that intelligent behaviour is defined by the sociocultural context in which it takes
place and involves adaptation to the environment, selection of better environments, and shaping of the present environment** `(Kearsley, 2001)`.

The addition of social context as a factor in cognitive development links Sternberg to the `interactional theories of development of Bruner
(1977, 1986) and Vygotsky (1978)`. These theories, and others of this type, are premised on the assumption that **learning does not occur in
a vacuum. Therefore, one must discuss the social and cultural contexts of learning**.

`Driscoll (2001)` says, **Of central importance is viewing education as more than curriculum and instructional strategies. Rather, one must
consider the broader context in how culture shapes the mind and provides the toolkit by which individuals construct worlds and their conceptions
of themselves and their powers**.

> These theories all work under the assumption that new information can most effectively be learned if the material can be matched to
> memory structures already in place `(Winn and Snyder, 2001)`.

**Most theories hold that the mind contains some type of framework into which new information is placed**. This structure is `multi-leveled` and
has `varying degrees of specificity`. New information can be `matched with`, `compared to`, `contrasted to`, `joined with`, or `modified to fit`
with existing structures.

This in place structural system allows for differing levels of complexity of information processing. The formation of and continual building
of these structures, then, is critical in order for learners to process information in various ways and at higher levels.
