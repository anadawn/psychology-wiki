# Summary
> One of the most fascinating and mysterious properties of the brain is its `capacity to learn`, or `its ability to change` in response to
> experience and to retain that knowledge throughout an organism’s lifetime.

> The ability to learn and to establish new memories is fundamental to our very existence, we rely on memory:
> - To engage in `effective actions`,
> - To `understand the words we read`,
> - To `recognise the objects we see`,
> - To `decode the auditory signals representing speech`,
> - And even `to provide us with a personal identity and sense of self`.

> Learning is acquiring new `knowledge`, `behaviours`, `skills`, `values`, `preferences` or `understanding`, and may involve `synthesising` and
> `processing` different types of information.

> Memory is usually divided into three storage systems:
> - Sensory
> - Short-term
> - Long-term.

> We then discussed `Miller’s Magic number`. We pointed out how within `STM`, there are 3 basic operations:
> - Iconic memory
> - Acoustic memory
> - Working memory.

> Long Term Memory has been then presented which includes schemas etc. Then the principles of information processing was taken up and and
> highlighted the limited capacity of the mental system and secondlhy the control mechanism is required to oversee the `encoding`, `transformation`,
> `processing storage` etc.

> Then we dealt with `information processing in learning and memory`.  It was pointed out that from  an information processing perspective
> some of the most important aspects include
> - Brain changes brought about by biological maturation or experience
> - Increased processing capacity, speed, and efficiency as a result of both maturation and knowledge development
> - Modifications of connections in a neural network
> - New emergent concepts arising from repeated self-organisation as a result of adapting to the demands of a changing environment
> - Increased capacity for problem-solving and metacognition.

> Then we discussed about `encoding` which involves `structuring`, `organising`, `storage`, `retrieval` etc.

> This was followed by `theories of information processing` which highlighted `Bloom’s Taxonomy` and  `Sternberg’s information processing theory`.
> It was  pointed out that that `new information can most effectively be learned if the material can be matched to memory structures already in
> place`.

> Most theories hold that the mind contains some type of framework into which new information is placed. This structure is multi-leveled
> and has varying degrees of specificity. New information can be matched with, compared to, contrasted to, joined with, or modified
> to fit with existing structures.
