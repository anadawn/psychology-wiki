# Learning and Memory
> Learning is acquiring new knowledge, behaviours, skills, values, preferences or understanding, and may involve synthesising and processing
> different types of information.

`Benjamin Bloom (1965)` has suggested `three domains of learning`:

- **Cognitive** – *to recall, calculate, discuss, analyse, problem solve, etc.*
- **Psychomotor** – *to dance, swim, ski, dive, drive a car, ride a bike, etc.*
- **Affective** – *to like something or someone, love, appreciate, fear, hate, worship, etc.*

`These domains are not mutually exclusive.`

**For example**

> in learning to play chess, the person will have to learn the rules of the game `(cognitive domain)` but he also has to learn how to
> set up the chess pieces on the chessboard and also how to properly hold and move a chess piece `(psychomotor)`.
> Furthermore, later in the game the person may even learn to love the game itself, value its applications in life, and appreciate
> its history `(affective domain)`.

`Memory is usually divided into three storage systems`

- Sensory
- Short-term,
- Long-term.

## Sensory Memory
**Sensory memory is affiliated with the transduction of energy (change from one form of energy to another)**. The environment makes available
a variety of sources of information `(light, sound, smell, heat, cold, etc.)`, **but the brain only understands electrical stimulation**.

The body has special sensory receptor cells that transduce this external energy to something the brain can understand.
In the process of transduction, a memory is created. This memory is very short `(less than 1/2 second for vision, about 3 seconds for hearing)`.
**The sensory memory retains an exact copy of what is seen or heard (visual and auditory)**.

> It is absolutely critical that the learner attend to the information at this initial stage in order to transfer it to the next one.

There are two major concepts for getting information into STM:

1. Individuals are more likely to pay attention to a stimulus if it has an interesting feature.
1. Individuals are more likely to pay attention if the stimulus activates a known pattern.

## Short-Term Memory (STM)
After entering sensory memory, a limited amount of information is transferred into short-term memory. **Selective attention determines what
information moves from sensory memory to short-term memory.**

`STM` is most often stored as `sounds`, especially in `recalling words`, but may be stored as `images`.

> It works basically the same as a computer’s RAM (Random Access Memory) in that it provides a working space for short computations and
> then transfers it to other parts of the memory system or discards it.

**STM is vulnerable to interruption or interference.** STM is characterised by:

- A limited capacity of up to seven pieces of independent information (Miller,1956).
- The brief duration of these items last from 3 to 20 seconds.
- Decay appears to be the primary mechanism of memory loss.

### Miller’s Magic Number
`George Miller’s classic 1956 study` found that **the amount of information which can be remembered on one exposure is between five and nine
items, depending on the information**. Applying a range of `+2` or `-2`, the number `7` became known as `Miller’s Magic Number`,
**the number of items which can be held in Short-Term Memory at any one time**.

Miller himself stated that his magic number was for items with one aspect. His work is based on subjects listening to a number of auditory tones
that varied only in pitch. Each tone was presented separately, and the subject was asked to identify each tone relative to the others s/he
had already heard, by assigning it a number. After about five or six tones, subjects began to get confused, and their capacity for making
further tone judgments broke down.

He found this to be true of a number of other tasks. But if more aspects are included, then we can remember more, depending upon our
familiarity and the complexity of the subject `(in Miller’s research, there was only one aspect — the tone)`.

**For example**

> we can remember way more human faces as there are a number of aspects, such as `hair color`, `hair style`, `shape of face`, `facial hair`, etc.
> We remember phone numbers by their aspects of `2` or more groupings, i.e. chunking. We don’t really remember `seven` numbers.
> We remember the first group of three and then the other grouping of four numbers. If it is long distance, then we add an area code.
> So we actually remember `10` numbers by breaking it into groups of three.

Within STM, there are three basic operations

- Iconic memory - The ability to hold visual images.
- Acoustic memory - The ability to hold sounds. Acoustic memory can be held longer than iconic memory.
- Working memory - Short-term memory is also called working memory and relates to what we are thinking about at any given moment in time.
In `Freudian terms`, this is `conscious memory`. It is created by our paying attention to an external stimulus, an internal thought, or both.
An active process to keep it until it is put to use `(think of a phone number you’ll repeat to yourself until you can dial it on the phone)`.

Note that the goal is not really to move the information from `STM to LTM`, but merely put the information to immediate use.

## Long-Term Memory (LTM)
This is relatively `permanent storage`. **Information is stored on the basis of meaning and importance**.
The process of transferring information from `STM` to `LTM` involves the `encoding` or `consolidation of information`. This is not a
function of time, that is, the longer a memory stayed in `STM`, the more likely it was to be placed into LTM, but on organising complex
information in `STM` before it can be encoded into `LTM`.

In this process of organisation, the meaningfulness or emotional content of an item may play a greater role in its retention into `LTM`.
We must find ways to make learning relevant and meaningful enough for the learner to make the important transfer of information to
long-term memory. Also, on a more concrete level, the use of chunking has been proven to be a significant aid for enhancing the `STM` transfer
to `LTM`.

> Remember, `STM`’s capacity is limited to about seven items, regardless of the complexity of those items.

**Chunking allows the brain to automatically group certain items together, hence the ability to remember and learn better**. The knowledge
we store in `LTM` affects our perceptions of the world, and influences what information in the environment we attend to.

**`LTM` provides the framework to which we attach new knowledge**. It contrasts with `short-term` and `perceptual memory` in that
information can be stored for extended periods of time and the limits of its capacity are not known.

**Schemas are mental models of the world**. Information in `LTM` is stored in interrelated networks of these `schemas`.
These, in turn, form `intricate knowledge structures`. Related schemas are linked together, and information that activates one schema
also activates others that are closely linked.

**This is how we recall relevant knowledge when similar information is presented**.

> These schemas guide us by diverting our attention to relevant information and allow us to disregard what is not important.

**Since `LTM` storage is organised into schemas, instructional designers should activating existing schemas before presenting new information
can be helpful in processing of the new information**. This can be done in a variety of ways, `including graphic organisers`, `curiosity-arousing
questions`, `movies`, etc.

**`LTM` also has a strong influence on perception through top-down processing**.

> Our prior knowledge affects how we perceive sensory information. Our expectations regarding a particular sensory experience influence
> how we interpret it. This is how we develop bias.

Also, most `optical illusions` take advantage of this fact. An important factor for retention of learned information in `LTM` is
rehearsal that provides transfer of learning.
