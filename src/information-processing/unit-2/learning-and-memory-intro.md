# Introduction
One of the most fascinating and mysterious properties of the brain is its `capacity to learn`, or **its ability to change in response to
experience and to retain that knowledge throughout an organismâ€™s lifetime**. The ability to learn and to establish new memories is fundamental
to our very existence.

> we rely on memory to engage in `effective actions`, `to understand the words we read`, `to recognise the objects we see`, `to decode
> the auditory signals representing speech`, and even to `provide us with a personal identity and sense of self`.

Memory plays such an important and ubiquitous role that it is often taken for granted the only time most people pay attention to
their memory is when it fails, as too often happens through brain injury or disease.
