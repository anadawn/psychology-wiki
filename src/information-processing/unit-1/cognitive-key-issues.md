# Key Issues In The Study of Cognitive Psychology
If the important ideas are reviewed, it is observed that some major themes underlie all of cognitive psychology.
Some of these issues are discussed dialectically here.

## Nature versus Nurture

**Which is more influential in human cognition `nature` or `nurture`?**

> If we believe that innate characteristics of human cognition are more important, we might focus our research on studying innate
> characteristics of cognition.

> If we believe that the environment plays an important role in cognition, we might conduct research exploring how distinctive
> characteristics of environment seem to influence cognition.

## Rationalism versus Empiricism
How should we discover the truth about ourselves and about the world around us? Should we do so by trying to reason logically,
based on what we already know? Or should we do so by observing and testing our observations of what we can perceive through our senses?
And how can we combine theory with empirical methods to learn the most we can about cognitive phenomena?

## Structures versus Processes
Should we study the structures (contents, attributes, and products) of the human mind? Or should we focus on processes of human thinking?

## Domain generality versus Domain specificity
Are the processes we observe limited to single domains, or are they general across a variety of domains? Do observations in one domain
apply also to all domains, or do they apply only to specific domains observed?

## Validity of causal inferences versus Ecological validity
 Should we study cognition by using highly controlled experiments that increase the probability of valid inferences regarding causality?
 Or should we use more naturalistic techniques?

## Applied versus Basic research
Should we conduct research into fundamental cognitive processes? Or should we study ways in which to help people use cognition
effectively in practical situations?

## Biological versus Behavioural methods
Should we study the brain and its functions directly, perhaps even scanning the brain while people are performing cognitive tasks?
Or should we study peopleâ€™s behaviour in cognitive tasks, looking at measures such as percentage correct and reaction time?

Note that these questions can be posed in the `either/or` form of `thesis/antithesis`, or in the `both/and` form of a `synthesis of views`
or `methods`, which often proves more useful than one extreme position or another.
