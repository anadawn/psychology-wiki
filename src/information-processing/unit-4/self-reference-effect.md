# Self Reference Effect
New light was shed on the levels-of-processing concept when `Rogers, Kuiper, and Kirker (1977)` showed that self-reference is a powerful method
variable. Using a method similar to that of `Craik and Tulving (1975)`, they asked subjects to evaluate a list of forty adjectives on one of four
tasks hypothesised to vary in depth, or semantic richness. Included were structural, phonemic, semantic, and self-reference tasks.

As in the Craik and Tulving study, it was assumed that words more deeply coded during rating should be recalled better than those words with
shallow coding. After the subjects rated the words, they were asked to free-recall as many of the words they had rated as possible. Recall was
poorest for words rated structurally and ascended through those phonemically rated and semantically rated.

Self reference words were recalled best. The Narcissistic Trait Modifications of the original experiment have been conducted in several laboratories
with the results being about the same. Some have argued that self-reference tasks are stored in some special memory system. Certainly, if you
are asked to evaluate a personality trait as being self-descriptive, such as greedy, loving, or angry, you are engaging a very powerful self-schema,
an organised system of internal attributes that is constellated around the topic of `I, me, mine.` We also call this the narcissistic trait.

Since we all know a great deal about ourselves (and are emotionally, if not intellectually, deeply invested in ourselves) we have a rich and
elaborate internal network available for storing self-information. Because of these complex internal self structures we can more easily organise new
information as it might refer to ourselves than other, more mundane information `(see Bellezza 1992 for several important studies on this theme)`.

Whether or not these self-rating memories are stored in different parts of the brain remains a question, but it is a good hunch that plenty of
precious brain space is given over to the narcissistic trait.
