# A Connectionist (Parallel Distributed Processing) Model of Memory: Rumelhart and Mcclelland
Many people have been associated with this model of human cognition, but `David Rumelhart and James McClelland` have done the most to formalise
the theory.

> *Essentially, the model is neutrally inspired, concerned with the kind of processing mechanism that is the human mind. Is it a type of `von
> Neumann computer`, a `Johniac`, in which **information is processed in sequential steps?** Alternatively, **might the human mind process
> information in a massively distributed, mutually interactive parallel system in which various activities are carried out simultaneously
> through excitation and/or inhibition of neural cells?***

`PDPers` opt for latter explanation. **These `[PDP]` models assume that information processing takes place through the interactions of a large
number of simple processing elements called `units`, each sending `excitatory` and `inhibitory` signals to other units** `(McClelland, Rumelhart,
& Hinton, 1986)`.

> *These units may **stand for possible guesses about letters in a string of words or notes on a score**. In other situations, **the units may
> stand for possible goals and actions, such as reading a particular letter or playing a specific note***.

Proponents suggest that **PDP models are concerned with the description of the internal structure of larger units of cognitive activity**, such as
`reading`, `perceiving`, `processing sentences`, and so on. The `connectionist (or PDP) model` attempts to describe memory from the even
finer-grained analysis of processing units, which resemble neurons.

Furthermore, the `connectionist model` is based on the development of laws that govern the representation of knowledge in memory. One additional
feature of the PDP model of memory is that it is not just a model of memory, it is also a model for action and the representation of knowledge.

**A fundamental assumption of the PDP model is that mental processes take place through a system of highly interconnected units, which take on
activation values and communicate with other units.**

> *Units are simple processing elements that stand for possible hypotheses about the nature of things, such as letters in a display, the rules
> that govern syntax, and goals or actions `(for example, the goal of typing a letter on a key board or playing a note on the piano)`.
> `Units` can be compared to `atoms`, in that **both are building blocks for more complete structures and combine with others of their kind to
> form larger networks.***

A neuron in the brain is a type of unit that combines with other neurons in a parallel processing mode to form larger systems.
Units are organised into modules, much as atoms are organised into molecules. The number of units per module range from thousands to millions.
Each unit receives information from other modules and, after processing, passes information to other modules.

In this model, information is received, is permeated throughout the model, and leaves traces behind when it has passed through. These traces
change in the strength (sometimes called weight) of the connections between individual units in the model.

> *A memory trace, such as a friend’s name, may be distributed over many different connections. The storage of information (for example, friend’s name)
> is thought to be content addressable, that is, we can access the information in memory on the basis of its attributes. You can recall your
> friend’s name if I show you a picture of him, tell you where he lives, or describe what he does. All of these attributes may be used to access
> the name in memory.*

Of course, some cues are better than others. Even though the theory is abstract, it touches real-life activities.

> *To continue with the example of your friend’s name, suppose I ask, `What is the name of the man you play tennis with?` Such an inquiry gives

> - *Tennis partner.*

> *If you play tennis with only one man (and you know his name), then the answer should be easy. If you have many partners who are men,
> then the answer may be impossible. Additional information `(for example, the man with the beard, the left handed player, the guy with red
> tennis shorts, the dude with the rocketlike serve, the chap with the Boston terrier, and so forth)` may easily focus the search.
> You can imagine how very narrow the search would be if all of these attributes were associated with only one person: the man you play tennis with
> has a `beard`, `is left-handed`, `wears red tennis shorts`, `has a hot serve`, and has a `terrier`. In real life, each of these attributes
> may be associated with more than one person. You may know several people who have a hot serve or have a beard. If that is the case, it is possible
> to recall names other than the intended one. However, if the categories are specific and mutually exclusive, retrieval is likely to be accurate.*

How can a PDP modular concept of memory keep these interfering components from running into each other?

According to this model, **information is represented in memory in terms of numerous connections with other units**. If an attribute is part of
a number of different memories and is activated `(for example. What was your friend’s name ...?)`, then it will tend to excite all the memories
in which the attribute is a part. One way interfering components are kept from overrunning the system is to conceptualise the relationship between
units as being subject to inhibitory laws.

Thus, when we identify the person you play tennis with as a man, in theory we inhibit all searches for people who are women. When we add that he has
a Boston terrier, then we do not search for the names of people with whom you do not play tennis and who do not own a Boston terrier. Consider the
following example of prototype learning, suggested by `McClelland and Rumelhart (1986)`.

> *A small boy sees many different dogs, each only once and each with a different name. All the dogs have slightly different features but can be
> considered a variation of the prototype dog, the epitome of `dogness.` The boy forms a memory for a prototypical dog on the basis of experience
> with exemplar dogs. As in the case of faces, the boy is likely to recognise the prototype dog as a dog, even if he has never seen it. Of course,
> the boy is not likely to remember the names of each of the individual dogs, though the most recently seen dog may still be in memory.*

The rationale offered by the connectionist model for prototype formation in the case of the boy and his (prototype) dog is that each time the boy
sees a dog, a visual pattern of activation is produced over several of the units in the module. In contrast, the name of the dog produces a
reduced pattern of activation. The combined activation of all exemplar dogs sums to the prototype dog, which may be the stable memory representation.
Thus, the model, more detailed than presented here, seems to account for this form of memory quite nicely.

The connectionist model of memory has won many disciples in the past few years. Its popularity is due in part to its elegant mathematical models,
its relationship to neural networks, and its flexibility in accounting for diverse forms of memories.
