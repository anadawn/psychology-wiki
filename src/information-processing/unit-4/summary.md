# Summary
> *There are many different theories and models of information processing that focus on different aspects of `perceiving`, `remembering`, and `reasoning`.*

> *There are many constant themes of information processing regardless of the specific theory to which one subscribes.*

> *Almost all ideas related to how information becomes stored in memory agree that the learner more deeply and meaningfully processes information
> that is presented in a context-rich manner*.

> *One of the most important agreements is that elaboration is a key to permanently storing information in a way that facilitates its quick retrieval
> when it is needed.*

> *Most theories hold that the mind contains some type of framework into which new information is placed. This structure is multi-leveled
> and has varying degrees of specificity.*

> *New information can be matched with, compared to, contrasted to, joined with, or modified to fit with existing structures.*

> *The formation of and continual building of these structures, then, is critical in order to process information. This in-place structural system
> allows for differing levels of complexity of information processing.*
