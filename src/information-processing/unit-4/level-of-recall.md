# Level of Recall
In a report by `P. I. Zinchenko (1962, 1981)`, a Russian psychologist, `the matter of how a subject interacts with the material to be
learned and committed to memory` was introduced. The basic notion was that **words encoded by deep means would be retained in incidental memory
better than if encoded by other, superficial means. Thus the memorability of words was profoundly influenced by the goal of the subject at the
time the material was presented.**

Different goals were thought to activate different systems of connections because subjects have different orientations toward the material.
The thesis was tested in an experiment in which subjects were given ten series of four words. The first word was to be connected to one of the
other words, but the instructions varied for each of three groups.

> *An example of a series is `HOUSE` `WINDOW` `BUILDING` `FISH`. In the first condition the subjects were asked to identify the word whose
> meaning was different from the first word `(HOUSE FISH)`. In a second condition subjects were asked to make a concrete connection between
> the first word and one of the other words `(HOUSE—WINDOW)`. In the third condition the subjects were asked to make a `logical` connection
> between the first word and one of the other three words `(HOUSE—BUILDING)`.*

Zinchenko thought that by altering the instructions the subjects would not only have different goals toward the material but also be
required to examine each item for meaning. After a brief interrupting task, the subjects were asked to recall the items. In the condition
in which subjects formed logical connections between the first word and another word, recall of the target word occurred with greater frequency
than the other conditions.

**Recall of the concrete relationship words was greater than the no-meaning condition. Thus the `level of recall (LOR)`, as Zinchenko called it,
is determined by the goal of an action.** In the experiment cited, we can see that when subjects were given a learning set, or instructions
to process material at different levels (to use contemporary jargon), recall of the material was affected greatly.

Because the original paper was published in Russian and not widely distributed, it has not been incorporated into the larger framework of memory
models. Nevertheless, as we shall see, the experiment presented by Zinchenko, because of its theoretical importance to the concept of levels
of processing, which has had a profound influence on cognitive psychology, has important consequences for our conceptualisation of human memory.
