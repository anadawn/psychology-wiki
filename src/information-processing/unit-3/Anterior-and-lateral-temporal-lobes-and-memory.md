# Anterior And Lateral Temporal Lobes and Memory
If, as suggested earlier, the neocortex is crucial for the storage of memories, then it should be possible to demonstrate retrograde amnesia
with cortical damage, even though most amnesias are anterograde. In line with this proposal, **amnesia can be caused by damage to regions of the
neocortex**. One region of special interest is the temporal neocortex outside the medial temporal lobe.

> *Lesions that damage the lateral cortex of the anterior temporal lobe, near the anterior pole, lead to a dense amnesia that includes
> `severe retrograde amnesia`, in such cases the `entorhinal cortex` and `perihippocampal cortex` may be involved.*

**The retrograde amnesia may be severe, extending back many decades before the amnesia-inducing event occurred or encompassing the patient's
entire life**. Various forms of damage can lead to this condition. Progressive neurological diseases like `Alzheimerâ€™s`, and `herpes simplex
encephalitis` involving viral infection of the brain are two such  conditions.

**Some patients with dense retrograde amnesia might still form new long-term memories**. This type of amnesia is called `isolated retrograde amnesia`.
It is particularly related to `damage of the anterior temporal lobe`. This portion of the temporal lobe is not, therefore, essential for acquiring
new information.

**Are these lateral and anterior regions of the temporal lobe the sites of storage of long-term declarative memories?**

> *The answer is `maybe`, but another view is that these regions may be particularly important for the retrieval of information from long-term stores.*

**Where then are memories stored?**

> *More recent evidence from neuroimaging studies suggests that memories are stored as distributed representations throughout `neocortex`,
> involving the regions that originally encoded the perceptual information and regions representing information that was associated with this
> incoming information `(as noted in the last section, the medial temporal lobe may coordinate the consolidation of this information over time)`.*
