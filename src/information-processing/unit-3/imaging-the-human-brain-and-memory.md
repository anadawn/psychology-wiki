# Imaging the Human Brain and Memory
The work described so far has dealt with evidence from humans and animals with brain damage. These data are consistent with regard
to the role of the medial temporal lobe in memory. Over the past decade, there has been an exponential increase in studies of normal
subjects using functional brain imaging methods. The results are quite provocative and are confirming and extending the findings from lesion
studies.

In the following, we review recent studies of the brain organisation of:
- Episodic memory
- Semantic memory
- Procedural memory
- Perceptual representation system (PRS)

## Episodic Encoding and Retrieval
Given the purported role of the hippocampus system in encoding memory in long-term stores, researchers have eagerly addressed this issue
using `positron emission tomography (PET)` and `functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)`.

One such line of work involved face encoding and recognition. The question was whether the Hippocampus becomes active when encoding new information.

> *`James Haxby, Leslie Ungerleider, and their colleagues (1996)` at the NIMH presented subjects with pictures of either faces or nonsense
> patterns, and, using PET, investigated memory performance. In different conditions subjects were required to remember (encode) the face,
> recognise the face, and perceptually analyse the face by comparing two faces. During these periods, PET scans recorded changes in `regional
> cerebral blood flow triggered by local neuronal activity`. These investigators observed that **the right hippocampus region was activated during
> encoding of the face but not during recognition, where retrieval processes should have been engaged.** These data are consistent with those from
> amnesic patients who had medial temporal lobe damage that led to anterograde amnesia but preserved distant retrograde memories.*

Encoding also activated the `left prefrontal cortex`, whereas recognition activated the `right prefrontal cortex`. Thus, we have more support
for the hippocampus’s role in memory, as well as possible support for `hemispheric asymmetries` in memory functions.

**Encoding and retrieval processes were lateralised in the left and right hemispheres, respectively, giving rise to a model with the acronym
of `HERA`**, which stands for `hemispheric encoding-retrieval asymmetry`. This model represents the idea **that encoding involves the left
hemisphere more than the right, and retrieval involves the right hemisphere more than the left**.

Both processes predominantly involve the `dorsolateral prefrontal cortex`. In encoding and retrieving information from long-term memory,
`neocortical areas` were the most activated. Some more recent studies made use of event-related fMRI methods to track the processing of
individual items as a function of the success of the encoding, as indexed by later memory performance.

> *`Anthony Wagner and his colleagues at MIT, Harvard University, and Massachusetts General Hospital (1998)`, and `John Gabrieli and his colleagues
> at Stanford (Brewer et al., 1998)` conducted such studies. They presented subjects with items and scanned their brains using of MRI while
> they were encoding the information, and then later tested them for their memories of the items. **Each research group found that event-related
> responses were larger in `prefrontal` and `medial temporal regions (parahippocampal cortex)` during encoding of words or pictures that were later
> remembered.***

## Semantic Encoding and Retrieval
The encoding and retrieval of semantic knowledge also have been studied using functional neuroimaging, and significant new findings have been
uncovered. In particular, **evidence for domain-specific organisation `(i.e., knowledge of animate and inanimate objects is localised in
different cortical regions)` has proved to be a fascinating story**.

> *Unlike episodic retrieval that activates the `right prefrontal cortex`, semantic retrieval involves the `left prefrontal cortex`.
> The region includes `Broca’s area (Brodmann’s area 44 extending into area 46)` and the `ventral lateral region (Brodmann’s areas 44 and 45)`
> `(Figure 1.3.3)`. This lateralisation to the left hemisphere remains regardless of whether the memories being retrieved are of objects or words.*

## Procedural Memory Encoding and Retrieval
Earlier we learned that amnesics demonstrate `implicit learning of motor sequences (procedural knowledge)` even when they cannot form
`explicit memories` about the stimulus sequence. **Amnesics provide powerful evidence that implicit learning need not be mediated by
explicit knowledge about the material**.

> *`Scott Grafton, Eliot Hazeltine, and Ivry (1995)` investigated the `brain basis of procedural motor learning` in normal subjects.
> They compared conditions in which the subjects learned motor sequences implicitly during dual-task conditions, which helped to prevent
> subjects from explicitly noticing and learning the sequence. `PET` conducted during the dual-task condition demonstrated **activation
> of the motor cortex and the supplementary motor area of the left hemisphere, and the putamen in the basal ganglia bilaterally**.
> Also activated were the `rostral prefrontal cortex` and `parietal cortex`. Therefore, **when subjects were implicitly learning the task,
> brain areas that control limb movements were activated. When the distracting auditory task was removed, the `right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex`,
> `right pre motor cortex`, `right putamen`, and `parieto-occipital cortex` were activated bilaterally.*

## Perceptual Priming and Implicit and Explicit Memory
`Daniel Schacter and his colleagues (1996)` at Harvard University investigated the `neural bases of perceptual priming (implicit learning)` in
a `PET` study. The scanning was performed only during the task. Subjects manifested implicit priming behaviourally. **No activations or
deactivations were noted in the hippocampus, but blood flow in the `bilateral occipital cortex, (area 19)` decreased `(Figure 1.3.3)`**.

**The hippocampus was not activated, then, even though implicit perceptual priming was obtained**. The conclusions from this and other studies
are that **`implicit` and `explicit` retrieval of information is subserved by separate brain systems**. Together with the face encoding data
`Haxby and colleagues` obtained by `PET`, and `animal and human lesion data`, a reasonable conclusion is that **the hippocampus encodes new
information but also retrieves recent information when explicit recollection is involved**.

Perhaps more interestingly, **deactivation of the visual cortex for previously seen words is a correlate of perceptual priming**.

> *In summary, neuroimaging studies have demonstrated patterns of neuronal activation that are consistent with memory systems derived from
> `cognitive research`, `studies in human amnesics`, and `animal models`. Neuroimaging also has provided some notable new findings in the
> cognitive neuroscience of memory, including, for example, the `hemispheric asymmetries in encoding and retrieval`.*
