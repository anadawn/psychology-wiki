# Cellular Bases of Learning and Memory
How does the activity of different brain regions change as memories are formed?

How would synaptic strength be altered to enable learning and memory?
`Neil Carlson (1994)` described some basic physiological mechanisms for learning new information. One basic mechanism is `Hebb’s law`,
named after the man who posited it, Canadian psychologist `Donald Hebb`, in `1949`. **Hebb’s rule states that if a synapse between two neurons
is repeatedly activated at about the same time the postsynaptic neuron fires, the structure or the chemistry of neuron changes and the
synapse will be strengthened** this is known as `Hebbian learning`.

A more general, and more complex, mechanism is called `long-term potentiation (LTP)`. In this process, **neural circuits in the hippocampus
that are subjected to repeated and intense electrical stimulation develop hippocampal cells that become more sensitive to stimuli.**
That an excitatory input and postsynaptic depolarisation are needed to produce LTP is explained by the properties of the doubly gated
`N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)` receptor located on the `dendritic spines` of `postsynaptic neurons `that show LTP. **`Glutamate` is the major
excitatory transmitter in the `hippocampus`, and it can bind with `NMDA` and `non-NMDA` receptors.**

When `2-amino-5 phosphonopentanoate (AP5)` is introduced to neurons, `NMDA` receptors are chemically blocked and `LTP` induction is prevented.
But the `AP5` treatment does not produce any effect on previously established `LTP` in these cells. **Therefore, `NMDA` receptors are central to
producing LTP but not maintaining it.**

It turns out that maintenance of `LTP` may depend on the `non-NMDA` receptors.

## Long-Term Potentiation and Memory Performance
This effect of enhanced response can last for weeks or even longer, suggesting to many that this could be a mechanism for long-term learning
and retention `(Baddeley, 1993)`. **Disrupting the process of long-term potentiation (say, through different drugs) also disrupts learning and
remembering**.

Chemically blocking LTP in the hippocampus of normal mice impairs their ability to demonstrate normal place learning, thus, **blocking LTP
prevents normal spatial memory**. In a similar way, genetic manipulations that block the cascade of molecular triggers for LTP also impair
`spatial learning`.

These experiments provide strong evidence of impairing spatial memory by blocking NMDA receptors and preventing LTP. Moreover, we are rapidly
developing a very clear understanding of the molecular processes that support synaptic plasticity, and thus learning and memory in the brain.
