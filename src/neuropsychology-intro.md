# Introduction
What is the relationship between learning and memory?

> Learning is the process of acquiring new information, whereas memory refers to the persistence of learning in a state that can be revealed
> at a later time `(Squire, 1987)`.

Learning, then, has an outcome, and we refer to that as memory. To put it another way, **learning happens when a memory is created or is
strengthened by repetition**. This need not involve the conscious attempt to learn. Learning can occur and performance can improve simply
from more exposure to information or to a task.

**For example**

> we remember the details of a personâ€™s face better by seeing it more, without having to try to consciously memorize facial features.

Learning and memory can be subdivided into major hypothetical stages:
- Encoding
- Storage
- Retrieval.

`Encoding` refers to the processing of incoming information to be stored. The encoding stage has two separate steps:
- Acquisition
- Consolidation.

    `Acquisition` registers inputs in sensory buffers and sensory analysis stages, while `consolidation` creates a stronger representation over time.

`Storage`, the result of acquisition and consolidation, creates and maintains a permanent record.

`Retrieval` utilises stored information to create a conscious representation or to execute a learned behaviour like a motor act.

We search for the neural correlates of learning and memory in many ways:
- Through case studies which reveal what is and is not lost in amnesia
- By developing animal models of memory in simple (invertebrates) and complex systems (nonhuman primates)
- With brain imaging to investigate normal encoding, retrieval, and recall in healthy humans.

In this chapter we will explore all these methods in brief in order to understand the neural basis of learning and memory.
