# Key Ideas in Cognitive Psychology
Certain key ideas seem to keep emerging in cognitive psychology, regardless of the particular phenomenon one studies.
Here are what might be considered the five major ideas:

- Data in cognitive psychology can be fully understood only in the context of an explanatory theory, but theories are empty without empirical data.
- Cognition is generally adaptive but not in all specific instances.
- Cognitive processes interact with each other and with noncognitive processes.
- Cognition needs to be studied through a variety of scientific methods.
- All basic research in cognitive psychology may lead to applications, and all applied research may lead to basic understandings.

## Computer Metaphor and Human Cognition
Although `Pascal`, `Descartes`, and others dreamt of computing machines centuries ago, it was not until the development of high-speed
digital computers more than fifty years ago that practical machines were invented. These machines gained enormous acceptance and are
presently used in virtually every aspect of modern life. Originally, such devices were thought to be wonderful number crunchers capable
of performing a multitude of complex mathematical operations in a fraction of the time required by humans. **However, it was quickly
discovered that they could perform functions that resembled human problem solving. However, what computers do well (perform high-speed
mathematical functions and abide by rule-governed logic) humans do poorly, relatively speaking. And what humans do well (form generalisations,
make inferences, understand complex patterns, and have emotions) computers do poorly, or not at all.**

Despite this problem, a second generation of cognitive-computer scientists is working toward building computers that looked something like a brain.
These new computers are sometimes called `neural networks` and act more like humans than the earlier versions. **They are able to make generalisations
and understand complex visual patterns, are slow at math, and make witless mistakes.**

Although they still do not have emotions, they are nevertheless a mark of success. **We now know that there are fundamental differences between the internal workings of computers and the internal
workings of the brain.**

Nevertheless, the computer metaphor continues to have a profound and generally positive impact on the development of cognitive psychology.

## Cognitive Science
Three powerful areas of scientific development, namely, `computer science`, `neuroscience`, and `cognitive psychology`, converge to create
a new science called `cognitive science`. The boundaries between these disciplines are sometimes hard to distinguish, that is, some
cognitive psychologists may be closer to neuroscience, others to computer science. One thing is clear, that is **the science of human cognition
is undergoing a radical transformation as a result of major changes in computer technology and brain science**.

Cognitive psychology makes full use of recent discoveries in neuroscience and computer science that illuminate the cognitive properties of
the human species.

## Neuroscience and Cognitive Psychology
huring the early stages of cognitive psychology, little attention was given to `physiological psychology` or `neuroanatomy`.
Much of the early information on the brain and its functions resulted from head traumas incurred during wars and accidents.
**The central issue neurologists struggled with was whether the brain was a holistic organ, with operations distributed throughout
its infrastructure, or whether activities were localised and tied to specific regions.**

> For example, did learning a specific act take place in a localised area of the brain, or was learning distributed throughout many
> parts of the brain?

Among the most prominent of the scientists who wrestled with these issues was `Karl Lashley (1929)`. Recently progress has been made in the
field of neuroscience, which comprises both the structural aspects of the brain and its peripheral components, as well as the functional aspects.
**With the beginning of the twenty-first century, cognitive psychology seems poised to make another paradigm shift.** While the traditional
topics of `perception`, `memory`, `language`, `problem solving`, and `thinking` and the `method of experimental analysis` are still central
to the cognitive theme.  As is well known, **the use of neuro cognitive imagery promises to become one of the major means of investigating
cognitive functions in this century**.

`Neuro cognitive techniques`, which have been developing very rapidly in the past several decades, **allow us tosee deeper and more clearly
into the brain** and `the brain is believed to be the engine of cognition`. Virtually every area of cognition has been investigated with
neuro cognitive techniques.

These, techniques, `MRI`, `PET`, `EEG`, and the like, show not only the structures of cognition but also the processes involved. And, in many
instance, the results have been remarkable. While this trend is likely to continue and grow, it is important to recognise the central themes
in cognition mentioned above.
