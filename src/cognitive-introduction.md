# INTRODUCTION

`Cognitive psychology is the study of how people perceive, learn, remember, and think about information.`
A cognitive psychologist might study how people perceive various shapes, why they remember some facts but forget others, or how they learn language.
Consider some examples of everyday experiences that are also of theoretical interest to cognitive psychologists:

**How many times have you carefully proofread written work, only to be embarrassed later by an obvious error you overlooked?**

> Many times what we see is determined as much by the context in which it occurs as by what is actually there, an issue of pattern recognition.

**Have you noticed the difficulty of simultaneously taking notes in class and understanding a lecture?**

> Explanations of this kind of difficulties are found in the discussion of attention.

**When you dial the telephone directory assistance for a telephone number and do not have a pen to note it down, why do you have to repeat the number until you have dialed it? And why you have to make your call again to enquire the number if someone talks to you before you dial the number?**

> These are problems associated with the short term memory.

**Do you remember the experience of working on a problem or a puzzle that you were unable to solve, but after taking a break from the problem, you subsequently obtained a solution?**

> This phenomenon, known as incubation effect, along with other commonly experienced events is an aspect of problem solving.

**Why do objects look farther away on foggy days than they really are?**

> This discrepancy of perception can be dangerous, even deceiving drivers into having accidents.

These are just a few of the many examples of everyday experiences which are discussed and explored by the experiments
and theory of cognitive psychology.

Two points about these examples should be considered as we attempt to gain an overview of cognitive psychology.

1) `All represent instances of difficulty or failure of mental processes.` We rarely think of them unless they fail to work.
Failure of mental processes are immediately noticed because they can be frustrating, embarrassing, and sometimes even dangerous
and, consequently, such failures become useful tools for the psychological analysis of mental phenomena.

2) `Cognitive psychology is interested in what is generally called mental phenomena.`
In this sense, the examples just discussed are consistent with the dictionary definition of cognitive psychology: `"the scientific study of the mind‚Äù.`
