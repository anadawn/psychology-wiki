# Life Span Perspectives
Life span refers to the ongoing process that we go through while growing up. It is the period of time from conception extending to death.
Studying life span development is very important because it helps in describing and explaining the mysteries of human development. **Life span
development includes issues such as the extent to which development occurs through the gradual accumulation of knowledge versus stage like
development, or the extent to which children are born with innate mental structures versus learning through experience.**

Many researchers are interested in the interaction between personal characteristics, the individual’s behaviour, and environmental factors
including social context, and their impact on development. The scientific study of development is important not only to psychology, but also to
sociology, education, and health care. By better understanding how and why people change and grow, one can then apply this knowledge to helping
people live up to their full potential. **Life span development is defined as the pattern of change that begins at conception and continues through
the life cycle.**

Lifespan development can also be defined as a methodical, intra-individual change associated with progressions corresponding to age. The development
progresses in a manner implicating the level of functioning. **Life-span developmental psychology is the field of psychology which involves the
examination of both constancy and change in human behaviour across the entire life span, that is, from conception to death `(Baltes, 1987)`.**

Development occurs in different domains, such as:

- Biological (changes in our physical being)
- Social (changes in our social relationships)
- Emotional (changes in our emotional understanding and experiences)
- Cognitive (changes in our thought processes)

Some developmental psychologists prefer to restrict the notion of development only to changes which lead to qualitative reorganisation in the
structure of a behaviour, skill or ability `(Crain, 2000)`. **Lifespan development is a process in which the  progression initiates with the
emergence of a fetus from a one celled organism. As the unborn child enters the world, the environment in which the child exists begins to influence
the child’s development `(Educational Foundation, 2001)`**.  The developmental periods are:

- Child and adolescence
- Early adulthood
- Middle adulthood
- late adulthood

**The transition in each of the developmental periods, involves a necessary change in the character of the individual’s life and sometime this takes
up to six years to complete the change `(Smith, 2009)`.** The transition deals with the common developmental stages that human beings pass through:

- Birth
- Infancy
- Adolescent
- Adulthood
- Old age
- Death

## Understanding Life Span Development
**Human development is a multidisciplinary study of how people change and how they remain the same overtime.** It reflects the complexity and
uniqueness of each person and their experiences as well as commonalities and patterns across people.

There are four interactive forces that combine to shape human development  and these are given below:

1. **Biological forces** include all genetic and health related factors that influence the development of a child. They provide raw materials
`(in case of genetics)` and set boundary conditions `(in the case of one’s health)` for development. **examples includes:**

   - Prenatal development
   - Brain maturation
   - Puberty
   - Menopause
   - Facial expression and change in cardio-vascular functioning
   - Diet
   - Exercise

1. **Psychological forces** include all `internal perceptual`, `cognitive`, `emotional` and `personality` factors that affect the development of
a child. **examples include:**

   -  Intelligence
   -  Self confidence
   -  Honesty
   -  Self esteem

1. **Socio-cultural forces** include `interpersonal`, `societal`, `cultural` and `ethical` factors that affect the development of a child.
This is important to know that how people and environment interact with each other. The family, peers, coworkers and social institutions and culture
influence development. **`Poverty` is the example for socio cultural forces.**

1. **Life cycle forces** reflect differences in how the same event affects people of different ages. Each individual is a product of a unique
combination of these forces. No two individuals even in the same family experience these forces in the same way.

## Issues in Life Span Development
Life issues are common problems, issues and/or crises that happen to normal people living normal lives.

**Examples include**

> *managing one’s relationships so that they are healthy and functional, surviving disabilities, coping with grief, loss and self-esteem issues.

A number of major issues have emerged in the study of human development. These issues include the following:

- Is development due more to genetics or environment?
- Does development occur slowly and smoothly, or do changes happen in stages?
- Do early childhood experiences have the greatest impact on development,or are later events equally important?

### Continuity and Discontinuity
The question of whether development is solely and evenly continuous, or whether it is marked by age-specific periods.

> *Developmental Psychologists who advocate the continuous model describe development as a relatively smooth process, without sharp or distinct
> stages, through which an individual must pass. That is, **development is conceived of as a process of the gradual accumulation of a `behaviour`,
> `skill`, or `knowledge`.***

> *In contrast, those who hold to the second view would suggest that developmental change is best characterised as discontinuous in nature.
> **They describe development as a series of discrete stages, each of which is characterised by what had gone on in the past and how well the
> child was able to master the developmental tasks of that period etc.** These theorists suggest that behaviours or skills often change
> qualitatively across time, and that new organisations of behaviours, skills, or knowledge emerge in a rather abrupt or discrete fashion.*

### Stability and Change
Another issue which is of importance to developmental psychologists is the issue of `stability` versus `change`. The question here is whether
development is best characterised by stability, **for example:**

> *Does a behaviour or trait such as shyness stay stable in its expression over time or change.*

**To cite an  example:**

> *Could a person’s degree of shyness fluctuate across the life span?*

### Nature vs. Nurture
Whether the behaviour ultimately developed by the child is due to `hereditary factors` or `environmental factors`. This issue is of great
importance  to psychologists. The debate over the relative contributions of inheritance and the environment is one of the oldest issues in both
philosophy and psychology. This debate concerns the relative degree to which heredity and learning affect the behaviour of the individual. **Both
genetic traits and environmental circumstances are involved in an individual’s development, although the amount of influence the two has is not
clearly evident.** In fact it may be stated that the individual and his or her circumstances decide how much of the behaviour is influenced by
heredity factors and how  much by environmental factors.

Today, most psychologists believe that it is an interaction between these two forces that causes development.

> *Some aspects of development are distinctly biological, such as `sexual development during puberty`. However, the onset of puberty can be affected by `environmental factors` such as `diet and nutrition`.*

## Stages of Development
Often, developmental stages are defined by `milestones`. **The term milestone refers to the development that has to take place according to the
age of the child**.

> *For instance, almost all children start standing  and walking at the age of 1 year and more, start saying a few words by the time they are one and
> half to two years etc.*

That a developmental stage has been successfully passed is indicated by the child mastering the developmental tasks of the particular period of
development.  Often, special milestones mark children’s accomplishments, such as walking in infancy and entering school in early childhood, and
these milestones can help mark children’s movement inside and between developmental stages. Individuals pass various stages throughout their life.

There are systematic progressions in a certain order through a series of phases. Step by step they move closer to some form of adult status.
This movement can be seen as involving changes in intellectual and physical powers `(Example, changes in intelligence, expertise and ability to
reason)` and the impact of life events and experiences. The main developmental periods of a human being are:

- **Childhood and adolescence**: Birth to age 20 `(early childhood transition by age 03)`.
- **Early adulthood:** Age 17 to 45.
- **Middle adulthood:** Age 40 to 65.
- **Late adulthood:** Over 60 years of age `(Tennat and Pogson, 1995)`.

## Domains of Human Development
The domains of development are categories used by scientists. The categories include:

- Physical domains
- Psychological domains
- Cognitive domains
- Social domains

  - **The `physical domain` is characterised by how humans grow and change physically**, at all stages of development especially during childhood and
adolescence.  When the physical changes are maximum, this domain includes how humans view the world as development progresses as a result of
physical development and interactions.

  - **`Psychological domain` focuses on adjustment of the individual to the environment.** Adjustment is the process which is essential for survival
  of the organism. The child has to learn to `suck`, `ingest food`, `eliminate`, `breath on own`, `eliminate on own` etc, which activities were taken
care of when the child was still within the mother’s womb. Adjustment also is required as the child grows up to learn to eat on own, eliminate as
is required and not as the child wishes. The child has to learn to `talk`, `walk`, `express`, `communicate` and so on. All these adjustments are
again necessary if the child has to survive. Adjustment to self, others and environment are important tasks which become increasingly complex as the
child grows up, and which all the child has to master and accomplish. Success leads to healthy adjustment while failure leads to maladjustment.
Adjustments in the way the world is viewed as the body develops are also included in this domain.

  - **`Cognitive domain` focuses on `learning`, `attention`, `perception` and `memory` etc.** The manner in which learning takes place and how the
child makes progress in school and home are of great importance in the child’s growth and development. How these components of cognitive domain
functions and improves indicate the progress the child makes.

  - **The `social domain` deals with the adjustment to people that are with others and learn the right ways of interactions.** The cognitive domain
  is concerned with how learning occurs and why memory deteriorates during old age.  The social domain contains adjustment in variables within
  social situations such as personality research, social skills and developing relationships.

All the domains operate together and are affected by each other `(Boyd & Bee, 2006)`.
