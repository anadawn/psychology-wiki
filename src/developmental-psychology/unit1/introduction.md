# Introduction
From the moment the human child is first conceived, to the day the individual dies, they keep changing constantly and developing. While some
of the changes humans undergo are as a result of chance incidents and personal choices, the vast majority of life changes and stages the human
passes through are due to certain common biological and psychological factors partly inherited and partly environmental and are shared by all people.
**Development refers to the `biological` and `psychological` changes that occur in human beings between birth and the end of adoloscent, as
the individual progresses from dependency to increasing autonomy.

Because these developmental changes may be strongly influenced by the genetic and enviornmental factors during prenatal life and these are the
part of the study of child development. Developmental change may occur as a result of genetically-controlled processes known as maturation, or as
a result of environmental factors and learning, but most commonly involves an interaction between the two.

**Developmetal psychology refers  to development throughout the lifespan, and pediatrics,  the branch of medicine relating to the care of children**.
In this unit we are also going to introduce the concept of life span development. It deals with important developmental stages that human beings
go through birth, infancy, adolescence, adulthood, old age and death.

As the humans grow up from one stage to another stage they learn to make use of their body parts, learn how to express themselves and communicate
with persons, learn how to maintain relationship with others and how to love and care for others.

In this unit we will be focusing on the concept of development, issues and stages. In development of humans, and then put forward the concept of
life span development, and its characteristics and theories of child development.
