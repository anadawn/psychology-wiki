# Characteristics of Life Span Development
The lifespan perspective argues that significant modifications take place throughout development. It consists of development of humans in
`multidimensional`, `multidirectional`, `plastic`, `multidisciplinary`, and `contextual` factors.  The development involves three factors:

- Growth
- Maintenance
- Regulation.

Changes that occur are interpreted in terms of the requirements of the culture and context of the occurrences. **According to `Paul Baltes`, humans
have the `capacity`, `plasticity` and the `ability` for positive change to the environmental demands that are being made on the individual
constantly**.

Individual learns ways and means to compensate and overcome difficulties  throughout the life. **According to `Baltes` positive characteristics
of growing old such as learning ways to compensate and overcome `(Boyd and Bee, 2006)` are considered  important characteristics of old age.**

These characteristics form a family of beliefs which specify a coherent view of the nature of development. It is the application of these beliefs
as a coordinated whole which characterises the life-span approach. The important characteristics beliefs of the life span approach are given below:

1. **Lifelong development:** This belief has two separate aspects:
    - `First`, the potential for development extends across the entire life span, that is, there is no assumption that the life course must reach
    a plateau or decline during adulthood and old age.
    - `Second`, development may involve processes which are not present at birth but emerge throughout the life span. No age period dominates during
    development.

   Researchers increasingly study the experiences and psychological orientations of adults at different points in their development.
   Gains and losses in development occur throughout the life cycle.

1. **Development is Multidimensional:** Multidimensionality refers to the fact that development cannot be described by a single criterion such as
increases or decreases in a behaviour. It occurs in the biological, cognitive and social emotional domains.

1. **Development is Multidirectional:** The principle of multidirectional maintains that there is no single, normal path that development must or
should take. In other words, healthy developmental outcomes are achieved in a wide variety of ways. `Development is often comprised of multiple
abilities which take different directions, showing different types of change or constancy.` Some dimensions or aspects of development may be
increasing while others are declining or not changing.

1. **Development is Plastic:** Plasticity refers to the within-person variability which is possible for a particular behaviour or development.

   For example:
   > *Infants who have a hemisphere of the brain removed shortly after birth (as a treatment for epilepsy) can recover the functions associated with
   > that hemisphere as the brain reorganises itself and the remaining hemisphere takes over those functions.*

   A key part of the research agendas in developmental psychology is to understand the nature and the limits of plasticity in various domains of
   functioning. Development can be modified by life circumstances to some extent. `Plasticity involves the degree to which characteristics change
   or remain stable`.

1. **Development is Contextual:** Development varies across the different contexts in which we live our lives.

    For example

    > *Social and rural environments are associated with different sets of factors which have the potential to impact on development.*

    Understanding how development differs for individuals within these two settings requires an understanding of the differing contexts. It occurs in
    the context of a person’s biological make-up, physical environment and social, historical and cultural contexts.

1. **Development is Multidisciplinary:** The study of developmental psychology is multidisciplinary. That is, the sources of age-related changes do
not lie within the province of any one discipline.

   For example:

   > *psychological methodologies may not be appropriate for understanding factors that are sociological in nature. Rather, an understanding of human
   >  development will be achieved only by research conducted from the perspective of disciplines such as `sociology`, `linguistics`, `anthropology`,
   > `computer science`, `neuroscience` and `medicine`.*

1. **Development involves Growth, Maintenance, and Regulation:** The mastery of life involves conflict and competition among three goals of human
     Development:
   - Growth
   - Maintenance
   - regulation.

1. **Development is embedded in History:** Development is also historically situated and is always influenced by historical conditions. The
historical time period in which we grow up affects our development.

1. **Normative Age Graded Influences:**  Biological and environmental influences that are similar for individuals in a particular age group
`(example: Childhood, Puberty)` also influences development.

1. **Normative History Graded Influences:** Biological and environmental influences that are associated with history that are common to people of
a particular generation `(example: Depression, the AIDS epidemic)` also influences.

1. **Non-normative Events:** Unusual occurrences that have a major impact on an individual’s life, the `occurrence`, the `pattern`, and `sequence` of
these events are not applicable to most individuals `(e.g. Death of a parent at young age, getting a serious illness, winning a lottery)`.
