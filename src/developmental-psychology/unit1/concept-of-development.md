# Concept of Development
Development describes the growth of humans throughout the lifespan, from conception to death. It refers to development as patterns of change over
time. It does not just involve the biological and physical aspects of growth, but also the cognitive and social aspects related to the development.
**The scientific study of human development seeks to understand and explain how and why people change throughout life**. This field examines change
across a broad range of topics including motor skills and other psycho physiological processes.

**Cognitive development refers to the areas of `problem solving`, `moral understanding`, `conceptual understanding`, `language acquisition`, `social`,
`personality`, and `emotional development`, and `self-concept` and `identity formation`**. Growth is defined as an increase in size. In other words
development is defined as a progression towards maturity.

Even though development is a continuous process with competencies developing, then disappearing, only to appear at a later age, it is not
continuous in the sense that it increases constantly but rather in a series of waves with whole segments of development reoccurring repetitively.
For example, new borns walk, if held, and then this ability disappears only to reappear at eight or ten months of age.

## Goals of Development Changes
**The goal of development is to enable people to adapt to the environment in which they live.** Self actualisation is essential to achieve
these changes. It plays an important role in mental health, people who make good personal and social adjustment must have opportunities to
express their interest and desires in ways that give them satisfaction but, at the same time, conform to accepted standards. Lack of these
opportunities will result in frustrations and generally negative attitudes towards people and life in general.
