# Summary
> *In this unit you have studied about the detailed process of prenatal period, which is defined as extending from conception to birth and is
> approximately nine months long and it has many characteristics.*

> *It is the time when the heredity endowment and sex of the individual are determined, when conditions in the mother’s body can disturb the pattern
> of prenatal period.*

> *Before they are ready to produce new individuals, male sex go through the two preliminary stages*
>  - *Maturation*
>  - *Fertilisation*

> *Female sex cells go through the three stages*
> - *Maturation*
> - *Ovulation*
> - *Fertilisation.*

> *The prenatal period is divided into three stages:*
> - *The period of zygote*
> - *The period of embryo*
> - *The period of fetus.*

> *After a female egg is fertilised, it becomes known as a zygote.*

> *Once the egg is fertilised, the zygote begins a two-week period of rapid cell division and will eventually become an embryo.*

> *The zygote divides through a process known as mitosis, in which each cell doubles by dividing into two cells. This two-week stage is known as the
> germinal period of development and covers the time of conception to the implantation of the embryo in the uterus.*

> *The period of embryo, this extends from the end of the second week to the end of the lunar month.*

> The period of fetus, this extends from the end of the second lunar month to birth.*

> *Attitude of the significant person toward the newly created individual are established during the prenatal period.*

> *Environmental influences that adversely affect the child development during the pregnancy.*

> Some teratogens are diseases that infect the mother and infant.*

> *Some drugs and chemicals that cross from the mother’s bloodstream into the infant. X-rays and abortion, which affect the mother’s outside body.*
