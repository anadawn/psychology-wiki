# Characteristics of Prenatal Period
The prenatal period has some important characteristics, each of which has a long lasting effect on development during the life span.

- This is the most important and first period of development in the life span.
- It is the first but shortest period for the new born baby or infancy, which starts from the conception and ends at the birth time of baby.
This period  is approximately `270 to 280 days` or `nine months` of a calendar.
- `Heredity factors` are also important for prenatal development. It serves as the foundation for later development. While favourable or unfavourable
conditions both before and after birth may and probably will affect to some extent the physical and psychological traits that make up this heredity
endowment. **The changes will be quantitative and not qualitative.**
- **Favourable and unfavourable conditions of the mother‘s body can foster the development of hereditary potentials.** Some times the hereditary
potentials are so influenced by environmental  conditions that they affect the embryo or the fetus as the case may be affecting the development
adversely.
- **At the time of  conception, the sex of the  baby is fixed.** Except  when  surgery is used for sex transformation, the sex of the individual,
determined at the time of conception, remains the same and does not change.
- During the prenatal period, proportionally greater growth and development take place than any other time throughout the entire life of human.
- Before birth (during nine month) the child grows from microscopically small cell to an infant who measures approximately `twenty inches in length`
and weight, on the average `7 pounds`. **It is observed that during this time weight increases 11 million times.**
- Many believe that this time is more hazardous than other periods of the life span.  It certainly is a time when environment or psychological
hazards can have marked effect on the pattern of later development.
- During the prenatal period, the attitudes of people towards the newly created individual has significant impact on the development.
For example **the mother’s positive  attitude is essential to the normal development of the newly created individual**.
