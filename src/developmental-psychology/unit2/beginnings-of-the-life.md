# Beginnings of the Life
The new life begins with the combination of a male sex cell and female sex cell. The development of each individual begins when a sperm cell from the
male penetrates the wall of an ovum, or egg, from the mother. These sex cells are developed in the reproductive organs.

**For example.**

> *The  male sex cells are produced in the `male gonads`, `the testes`, while the female’s sex cells are produced in the `female gonads`,
`the ovaries`.*

Development begins at conception. At the moment that the tiny Tadpole shaped sperm penetrates the wall of the ovum, it releases 23 minute particles
called `chromosomes`. At approximately the same time, the nucleus, the inner core of the ovum, breaks up, releasing 23 chromosomes of its own, so that
the new individual begins life with `46 chromosomes`. All the child’s biological heritage from the father and mother is contained in these 23 pairs
of chromosomes. Of these pairs, 22 are `autosomes`, possessed equally by males and females. The 23 pair, the sex chromosomes, differs in males and
females. It is these chromosomes that determine a child’s sex. A female will have two X chromosomes (XX), while a male has an X and Y chromosomes
(XY).

Male and female sex cells also differ in two important ways. First, in the mature ovum there are 23 matched chromosomes while in the mature
spermatozoa there are 22 matched chromosomes and one unmatched chromosome which may be either an X or a Y chromosomes. The X and Y chromosomes are
the sex determinant chromosomes. The mature chromosome ovum always contains an X chromosome. If it is fertilised by a Y-bearing spermatozoa,
the offspring will be a boy. If  it is fertilised by an X-bearing spermatozoa, the offspring will be a  girl. Once the male and female cells have
united, nothing can be done to change the sex of the newly formed individual. Whether this individual is male or female has a lifelong effect on the
individual’s patterns of behaviour and personality. The question arises why the sex of an individual is important to lifelong development.
The answer of this question consists of three points, viz. the following:

- **Each year children come under increasing cultural pressure from parents, teachers, their peer group and society at large to develop attitudes
and behaviour patterns that are considered appropriate for members of their sex.** Children who learn to behave in ways that are considered
appropriate for their sex are assured of social acceptance.

- **Learning experiences are determined by the individual's sex.** Children learn what is considered appropriate for members of their sex.
A boy who learns to play girls’ games is called a sissy and girls who want to play boys games are called tomboy type girl.

- **Attitude of parents and other family members are also important to individuals.** During the early years, when the foundations of
personality pattern are being laid, the children (if twins)  must get equal share of the mother’s attention. Where the mother gives more attention
to one and not to the other, the latter may feel rejected and thus develop a personality which may be negative. **Recent studies show that the
traditional preference for a boy, especially for the first born, still persists which is so strong that the attitude of parents and family members
are affected and in the process the developing infant.**

The second way in which male and female sex cells differ is in the **number of preparatory stages of development they pass through before they are
ready to produce a new human being.** All sex cells, male or female, must pass through the preliminary stages of development as for example the 
male sex cell must go through `two` preliminary stages:

- Maturation
- Fertilisation

While female sex cell must go through `three` preliminary stages:

- Maturation
- Ovulation
- Fertilisation

- **`Maturation` is the process of chromosome reduction through cell division**.

    > *One chromosome from each pair goes to a subdivided cell, which in turn splits lengthwise and forms two new cells.*

    **The mature cell, which contains 23 chromosomes, is known as a `haploid cell.`** Maturation of sex cells does not occur until sex maturity
    has been attained, following the onset of puberty in both boys and girls.

- **`Ovulation` is a preliminary stage of development limited to the female sex cells.**

    > *It is the process of escape of one mature ovum during the menstrual cycle.*

    It is observed that the two ovaries alternate in producing a ripe ovum during each menstrual cycle.

- **`Fertilisation`, which occurs at the time of conception, is the third stage of development preliminary to the beginning of a new life.**
It normally occurs while the ovum is in the Fallopian tube.
