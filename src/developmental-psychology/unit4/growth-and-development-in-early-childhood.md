# Growth and Development in Early Childhood
Growth and development are complementary processes.
> *Growth indicates the bodily changes in a qualitatively way such as `height` and `weight`*

> *Development indicates the  changes in both the `qualitative` and `quantitative` way `(e.g. intelligence, creativity and language acquisition)`.

**Development can be defined as a `progressive series of orderly coherent changes.`**

The  various types of developmental changes follow certain principles. Some of these principles are as follows:

1. Growth and development follow an orderly sequence.
1. Each child normally passes through a number of stages, each with its own essential characteristics.
1. There are individual differences in rate and pattern of development.
1. Though the human being develops as a unified whole, yet each part of the body develops at a different rate.
1. Development is essentially the result of the interaction between maturation and learning.
