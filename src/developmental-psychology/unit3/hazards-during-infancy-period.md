# Hazards During Infancy Period
As mentioned earlier, the period of  infancy is the shortest period of development for a child. In this short time there are many hazards.
These hazards may be classified as:

- Physical hazards
- Psychological hazards.

## Physical hazards
The physical hazards of infancy though of low significance, **its effect on infant can affect the entire life span of the child.** Some physical
hazards are given below:

1. **Complication at the time of birth:** If the mother has some complications at the time of birth or delivery, chances of the child getting
physically injured are `high`. **A `caesarean` birth is likely to result in `anoxia`, a temporary loss of oxygen to the brain.** If the `anoxia` is
severe,  brain damage will be far greater than if `anoxia` lasts for only a few seconds.

   **The more complicated the birth and the more damage there is to the brain tissue,  greater will be the effect on the infant’s postnatal life
   and adjustment.** The use of too much medicine at the time of birth may lead to a serious complication.

1. **Multiple births:** Children of multiple births are usually smaller and weaker than singletons as a result of crowding during the prenatal
period, which inhibits fetal movements. These infants tend to be born premature, which adds to their adjustment problems.

1. **Post maturity:**  If the size of  fetus is  large then at  the time of birth, there may be a need to use instruments or surgery which becomes
hazardous to the infant. Critical conditions of birth may create a hazard for the infant.

1. **Pre maturity:** The condition of pre maturity may at times be the cause of death of the infant. **Prematurely born infants are also especially
susceptible to brain damage.**

    > *`Anoxia` is another problem when premature infant’s respiratory mechanism is not fully developed. This effect may be such that it can also be
    long lasting.*


## Psychological hazards
Like physical hazards some psychological hazards also affect the infancy period. Some of these are:

1. **Traditional beliefs about birth:**  There are many traditional beliefs associated with  birth. These beliefs  also affect the development of
the child. For example:
   > *Some people believe that those children born with difficult births, have difficult life situation.*

   > *Some believe that  there is  some good time or event during the birth.*

   But there is less scientific evidence to support these beliefs.

1. **Helplessness:** Helplessness is another struggle for the infant in outer world. At the time of birth infants are in hospital and under the care
of many doctors and nurses. **The helplessness of the newborn is more of a psychological hazard in the case of first born children  than of later-born children.**

1. **Attitude of parents:** The attitude of the parents may be changed at the time of birth. There are many reasons to change this attitude toward
the infant such as `gender preferences`, `excessive crying` and `difficulty in nourishment`, `complication at the time of birth` and `unexpected
arrival of twins and triplets`. **The mother’s attitude is more important for the infant because infants are in direct touch with their mother.**
