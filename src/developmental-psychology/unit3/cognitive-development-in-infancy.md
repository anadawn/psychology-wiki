# Cognitive Development in Infancy
**Cognition is a broad and inclusive concept that refers to the `mental activities` involved in the `acquisition`, `processing`, `organisation`, and
use of knowledge.** The major processes under the term cognition includes:

- Detecting , interpreting , classifying and remembering information
- Evaluating ideas
- Inferring principles and deducting rules imagining possibilities
- Generating and strategies
- Fantasizing and dreaming.

At the infancy period  children  develop many elements of abilities to think and to understand the world around them. Infants have remarkably
competent organisms, even on the first day of life. The newborn child is ready to the basic sensations of our species. They can `see`, `hear`,
and `smell`, and they are sensitive to `pain`, `touch`, and `changes in bodily position`.

**Infants are not only growing physically during the first 2 years of life, but also they are growing cognitively `(mentally)`.** Every day they
interact with  different persons and learn about their environment and pathways between nerve cells both within their brains, and between their brains
and bodies.

Cognitive change and development is a little harder to determine as clearly. Therefore, much about what experts know about mental and cognitive
development is based on the careful observation of developmental theories, such as `Piaget’s theory of cognitive development` and `Erikson’s
psychosocial stages`.

> *According to `Piaget’s  theory`,  **infants interact with their environment entirely through reflexive behaviours.** They do not think about what
> they are going to do, but rather follow their `instincts` and `involuntary reactions` to get what they need, such as `food`, `air`, and
`attention`.*

> *Piaget believed that as children begin to grow and learn about their environment through their senses, they begin to engage in intentional,
> goal-directed behaviours.*

> - *Jean Piaget was the most influential developmental psychologist of the twentieth century.*
> - *The work of cognition has held center stage in child development research since `1960`.*
> - *His theory of `cognitive growth and change` is original, comprehensive, integrative and elegant.*
> - *He recorded infant’s and children’s spontaneous activities, and presented problems of thousands of children and adolescents.*
> - *His ideas have been the source of many research studies.*

**In Piaget’s theory, knowledge is assumed to have a specific goal or purpose to aid the person in adapting to the environment.** The child does not
receive information passively, and thoughts are not simply the product of teaching by others. Nor is the cognitive progress seen as primarily a
product of maturation of a brain.

**Knowledge is acquired and thought processes become more complex and efficient as a consequence of the maturing child’s interactions with the
world.** The individual is active, curious and inventive throughout the life cycle.

**The theory of cognitive development is a comprehensive theory about the nature and development of human intelligence.** It deals with the nature of
knowledge itself and how humans come gradually to acquire it, construct it, and use it. Moreover, Piaget claims that **cognitive development is at
the centre of human organism and language is contingent on cognitive development.** Piaget considered  cognitive development in terms of stages:

1. Sensory motor stage (Birth -2years)
1. Pre operational stage (2-7 years)
1. Concrete operational stage (7-11years)
1. Formal operational stage (11-15 years).

Let us take up these stages one by one and discuss.

- **Sensory Motor Stage (Birth -2 years):** The first stage is the sensory motor stage which lasts from birth to about two years old.
The infant uses his or her senses and motor abilities to understand the world, beginning with reflexes and ending with complex combinations of
sensory motor skills. This stage can be divided into six separate sub-stages as given below:

  1. **Reflexes (birth -1 month):** The child understands the environment purely through inborn reflexes such as sucking and looking.
  1. **Primary Circular Reactions (1-4 months):** Between one and four months, the child works on an action of his own which serves as a stimulus
     to which it responds with the same action, and around and around we go.
  1. **Secondary Circular Reactions (4-8 months):** The child becomes more focused on the world and begins to intentionally repeat an action in
     order to trigger a response in the environment.
  1. **Coordination of Secondary Reactions (8-12 months):** Develop certain focuses on the demand object. Responses become more coordinated and
     complex.
  1. **Tertiary Circular Reactions (12-24 months):** Children begin a period of trial- and-error experimentation during this sub-stage.
  1. **Early Representational Thought:** Children begin to develop symbols to represent events or objects in the world in the final sensory motor
     sub-stage.
