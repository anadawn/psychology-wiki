# Adjustments During Infancy
As  already discussed **infants have to make certain important adjustments after birth.** They have to make these changes quickly for their better
development.  If  they are not able to effect those changes, they may face some problems regarding their adjustment. Even they may regress to a lower
stage of development. There are four major adjustments during infancy period, which are described below:

1. **Temperature changes:** There is a constant temperature of `100 degree F` in the `uterine sac`, while temperature in the hospital or home may
vary from `60` to `70 degree F`.

1. **Breathing:** When the umbilical cord is cut, infant must begin to breathe on its own.

1. **Sucking and Swallowing:** The infant must now get nourishment by sucking and swallowing, instead of receiving it through the umbilical cord.
**These reflexes are imperfectly developed at birth, and the infant often gets less nourishment than is needed and thus loses weight.**

1. **Elimination:** The infantâ€™s organs of elimination begin to work soon after birth. Earlier, the waste products were eliminated through
the umbilical cord.
