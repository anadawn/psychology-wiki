# Summary

> *The period of infancy covers approximately the `first two weeks of life`. There are five important characteristics in the infancy period.
> This is the shortest period of life span, it is the time of adjustment, a plateau in development and consists of hazards filled event in life.*

> *The hazards are divided into two types:*
> - *First is physical hazards such as:*
>   - *Unfavourable prenatal environment complication*
>   - *The time of birth*
>   - *Multiple birth*
>   - *Pre and post maturity*
>
> - *Second is the psychological hazards such as:*
>   - *traditional beliefs about birth*
>   - *helplessness*
>   - *attitude of parents*
>   - *etc.*
>
> *The infant has to do some adjustment in the outer life.*

> ***Physical development** refers by the physical growth and maturation.*

> ***Psychosocial development** is the development of a person’s understanding of the environment they are living in, and figuring out how that
> relates to them, their behaviour, and others. To put it in even simpler terms, **it is learning about yourself, through your surroundings and other
> people.***

> *`Erikson` defines `trust vs. mistrust` in infancy period. Other types of social behaviour are also mentioned such as `attachment`, `smiling`,
> `anxiety`, and `fear of stranger`.*

> *The theory of cognitive development is a comprehensive theory about the nature and development of human intelligence. It deals with the nature of
> knowledge itself and how humans come gradually to `acquire it`, `construct it`, and `use it`. Moreover, `Piaget` claims the **idea that cognitive
> development is at the centre of human organism and language is contingent on cognitive development.***

> *`Piaget` concerned the cognitive development in terms of stages. He mentioned four stages in cognitive development:*
> - *Sensory motor stage (Birth -2 years)*
> - *Pre operational stage (2-7 years)*
> - *Concrete operational stage (7-11 years)*
> - *Formal operational stage (11-15 years).*

> *Language development is a process starting early in human life, when a person begins to acquire language by learning it as it is spoken and by
> mimicry. Children’s language development moves from simple to complex. Infants start without language. There are four component of language
> development:*

> - *Phonology*
> - *Semantics*
> - *Grammar*
> - *Pragmatics.*
