# Psychosocial Develoment in Infancy
`Psychosocial development` is the development of a persons understanding of the environment they are living in, and figuring out how that relates to
them, their behaviour, and others. To put it in even simpler terms, **it is learning about yourself, through your surroundings and other people.**
The theory of psychosocial development is given by the psychoanalyst `Erik Erikson`. It is perhaps one of the best ways to understand the
psychosocial development in infancy period.

He describes the impact of social experience across the whole lifespan and it is one of the better theories of personality.

> *Erikson has characterised infancy as the period during which the child develops basic and long-lasting expectations about his world.*

The central idea of Erikson’s psychosocial stage theory is the development of `ego identity`.

> *Ego identity refers to the conscious sense of self that we develop through social interaction. **According to Erikson, our ego identity is
> constantly changing due to new experience and information we acquire in our daily interactions with others.***

**Erikson also believed that a sense of competence also motivates behaviours and actions.** Each stage is concerned with becoming competent in an area
of life. If the stage is handled well, the person will feel a sense of mastery, which he sometimes referred to as `ego strength` or `ego quality`.

If the stage is managed poorly, the person will emerge with a sense of inadequacy. Erikson also believed in each stage, people experience a conflict
that serves as a turning point in development. These conflicts are centered on either developing a psychological quality or failing to develop
that quality. During these times, the potential for personal growth is high, but so is the potential for failure.

The psychosocial theory include:

## Stage 1 - Trust vs. Mistrust (birth to 1 years).
The first stage of Erikson’s theory of psychosocial development occurs between birth and one year of age and is the most fundamental stage in life.
Because an infant is purely dependent on their family members, the development of trust is based on the dependability and quality of the child’s
caregivers. If an infant successfully develops trust, he or she will feel safe and secure in the world. Caregivers who are inconsistent,
emotionally unavailable, or rejecting contribute to feelings of mistrust in the children they care for. Failure to develop trust will result in fear
and a belief that the world is inconsistent and unpredictable.

**Trust and mistrust is the main feature of infant development.** A sense of trust requires a feeling of physical comfort and a minimal amount of fear
and apprehension about the future. Trust in infancy sets the stage for a lifelong expectation that the world will be a good and pleasant place to
live.

The infancy stage focuses on the infant’s basic needs, being met by the parents.

> *If the parents expose the child to warmth, regularly, and dependable affection, the infant’s view of the world will be one of trust.*

> *If the parents fail to provide a secure environment and fail to meet the child’s basic need, a sense of mistrust will result.*

> *If proper balance is achieved, the child will develop the virtue hope, the strong beliefs that, even when things are not going well, they will
> work out well in the end.*

> *Failing this, maladaptive tendency or sensory distortion may develop and the malignant tendency of withdrawal will develop.*

## Other type of social behaviours
 There are other types of social behaviours, which are discussed here:

1. **Attachment:**  A new born baby in arms is the greatest feeling of motherhood. **An infant always seek love and attention from mother and he
cries to be pick up , fed, and otherwise stimulated and often as not he cries when put down.**

   > *At six weeks, infant will smile at his mother face and grasp his cloth. At this age infant can recognise their caretaker and his faces.*

   He needs mother’s and father’s attention towards him. This early attachment is called `indiscriminate`. The infant seeks stimulation rather than
   any particular person.

   > *The concept of attachment is investigated by `Ainsworth and her associates (1978)`, was defined as an **emotionally toned relationship or tie
   > to the mother that led the infant to seek mother presence and comfort, particularly when the infant was frightened or uncertain.***

   This indicates that all healthy infants have healthy and strong attachment with their caretakers and this strong bonding provides the basis for
   healthy emotional and social development during later childhood.

1. **Smiling:**  Smiling is the means of communication for infants in early years. An early smile of the infant is just a facial exercise of the
muscles. **A child first pass his smile to his mother and this is at first bestowed indiscriminately between the mother and child.**  The smile is
an important influence on mother - child relationship. The mother’s responsive smile is equally important to the child. It transforms the spontaneous
smile of the infant into an exchange. This may be called `first real social interaction.` The social smile appears at `7` or `8` weeks of age, and by
`3 months` infants will smile almost any face. **This smile is important to the caretakers and child because it invites adult to interact with the
baby and therefore contributes to the attachment bonding.**

1. **Anxiety:** As we all know that mother and child relation is important in infancy period. **The child first recognised his mother face and infant
is aware that mother is special person at this time.** He is at once in a position to lose her.

    > *An infant around 10 months may be seen crawling behind his mother, from one room to another room. If mother is disappearing, he may be cry and
    > scream, and watch every door.  Even his crying and searching at different places is an indication of attachment with the mother.*

    **The increase in attachment behaviour is considered to be an indication of separation anxiety.**

1. **Fear of strangers:** A second anxiety that is a direct result of the infant’s first attachment is `stranger anxiety`. The child is specially
attach with the mother and he can be easily upset by the approach of an unfamiliar adult, especially if his mother is not present around.

    > *The infant fixes his eyes on the stranger and stares, unmoving, for a short time. He is likely to cry and show the signs of distress.
    > Stranger anxiety disappears toward the end of the first year, as the child comes in contact with a growing number of relatives.*
