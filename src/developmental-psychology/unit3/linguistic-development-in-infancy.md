# Linguistic Development in Infancy
Language development is a process starting early in human life, when a person begins to acquire language by learning it as it is spoken and
by mimicry. Children’s language development moves from simple to complex. Infants start without language. Yet by four months of age, babies can
read lips and discriminate speech sounds. The language that infants speak is called babbling. Speech replaces gestures and babbling as the child
starts communicating his  desires and ask questions during 6 months period.

**`Speech`, `symbolism`, `imitation of family members or others` and `morality` are the most distinctive characteristics of infants.**
After few months time the infant use their name and personal pronouns `I`, `me`, or `my`. **It represents the self awareness and self consciousness.**

Usually, language starts off as recall of simple words without associated meaning, but as children grow, words acquire meaning, with connections
between words being formed. As a person gets older, new meanings and new associations are created and vocabulary increases as more words are learned.

Infants use their `bodies`, `vocal cries` and `other preverbal vocalisations` to communicate their `wants`, `needs` and `dispositions`. Even though
most children begin to vocalise and eventually verbalize at various ages and at different rates, they learn their first language without conscious
instruction from parents or caretakers.

> mother’s voice.*

Language is acquired with amazing rapidity, particularly after children speak their first word, usually sometime around the end of the first year.
This can be understood during the months of 4-8 months child language characteristics is babbling such as, `baba`, `dada` and `gaga`.

> *At the age of  `12 months`, the  infant first utters the understandable words such as  `mommy`, `dog`, `dirty` and `yes`.*

> During *18* months the language transforms into two word combination such as `mommy milk`, `my pencil` and `drink juice`.*

There are four main components of language development in children. Each component has its own appropriate developmental periods.

1. **Phonology** involves the rules about the structure and sequence of speech sounds.
   >  - *From shortly after birth to around one year, the baby starts to make speech sounds.*
   > - *At around `two months`, the baby will engage in cooing, which mostly consists of vowel sounds.*
   > - *At around `four months`, cooing turns into babbling which is the repetitive combination of consonant and vowel.*

   Babies understand more than they are able to say. **From `1–2 years`, babies can recognise the correct pronunciation of familiar words.**
   Babies will also use phonological strategies to simplify word pronunciation. Some strategies include:
   > - *Repeating the first consonant-vowel in a multi syllable word `(TV —> didi)` or*
   > - *Deleting unstressed syllables in a multi syllable word `(banana—>nana)`.*

1. **Semantics** consists of vocabulary and how concepts are expressed through words.
   > *From birth to one year, `comprehension` (the language we understand) develops before `production` (the language we use).*

   There is about a `5 month` lag in between the two. Babies have an innate preference to listen to their mother’s voice. Babies can recognise
   familiar words and use preverbal gestures.

   > *From `1–2 years`, vocabulary grows to several hundred words.*

   There is a vocabulary spurt between 18–24 months, which includes `fast mapping`.

   > *`Fast mapping` is the babies’ ability to learn a lot of new things quickly.*

   The majority of the babies’ new vocabulary consists of `object words` (nouns) and `action words` (verbs).

   > *By 3–5 years, children usually have difficulty using words correctly.*

   Children experience many problems such as under extensions, taking a general word and applying it specifically `(for example, ‘blankie’)` and
   overextensions, taking a specific word and applying it too generally `(example, ‘car’ for ‘van’)`. However, children coin words to fill in for
   words not yet learned `(for example, someone is a cooker rather than a chef because a child will not know what a chef is)`.
   Children can also understand metaphors.

1. **Grammar** involves two parts.

   - The first part is `syntax`, it refers to the rules in which words are arranged into sentences.
   - The second is `morphology`, it refers to the use of grammatical markers `(indicating tense, active or passive voice etc.)`.

   From 1–2 years, children start using telegraphic speech, which are two word combinations.

1. **Pragmatics** involves the rules for appropriate and effective communication. The three skills involved in this include

   - Using language for greeting, demanding etc.
   - Changing language for talking differently depending on who it is you are talking to
   - Following rules such as turn taking, staying on topic, etc.

   From birth to one year, babies can engage in `joint attention` (sharing the attention of something with someone else).
   Babies also can engage in `turn taking activities`. By `1–2 years`, they can engage in `conversational turn taking` and `topic maintenance`.
