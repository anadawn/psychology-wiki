# Characteristics of Infancy Period
The characteristics of infancy period are as follows:

1. The `infancy period` is the shortest period of whole life-span development. It start’s from `birth` to `two years`. This is the  time when
fetus comes into the world from the mother’s womb where he lives almost nine critical months.

1. **Adjustment is equally important to the infant as he has to adjust with the outer surroundings.** Most of the infants complete their adjustment
period in `two weeks` or `less than two weeks`.  In infants whose birth has been difficult or premature require more time for adjustment.

1. **Infancy period is a plateau in development.** The growth and development which took place during the prenatal period suddenly come to a stop
with birth. **Infant loses weight after  birth,  is less healthy compared to what it was  at the time of birth.** At the end of this period infant
again starts gaining  weight.

1. `Bell, R.Q. et. al. (1971)` suggested that infancy is a period of future prediction. We can start some future prediction about the infant.
Some activities show the prediction of development. It is a preview of later development.

1. **Infancy is considered a period full of hazards in terms of physical and psychological adjustment.** Physical adjustment to the new environment
is difficult for the child. **The attitudes of the family members create more difficult situation for the infant.** Psychologically, the attitude of
significant toward the infant gets `crystallized`. This attitude changes from one stage to another.
